Samsung Health,"I did like this app 'cause it keeps my daily running record. But after it's update. It's totally rugged. It took me 30 minutes to complete 6000 steps and it takes me 50 minutes to complete same steps. Moreover, I can't track Weight Management. What have you done with it? It tells Good or Average. I ...",1
Samsung Health,"I love the app, but unfortunately it is draining my watch battery like no tomorrow. I read online that this is due to an update and is a very common issue. Kindly fix this issue. Thank you! I love this app! It literally has everything in one: Track my runs or bike rides outside, count my calories, give me workout routines and walk me through them. So excited about this app I bought Samsung Active watch to go along with it. Can't wait to use both of them for a long long time!",3
Samsung Health,"Overall, not super impressed. It doesn't sync with Google Fit or popular workout/training apps, which is the biggest disappointment I think. I don't think Google Fit is available to download to the watch either. I want to have all my fitness goals and progress in one place, and this doesn't do it. Also, I teach on the second floor of a school, and literally go up and down stairs several times per day, yet my floors count is only 1? What's up with that?",2
Samsung Health,"I used to love this app, but it has had so many issues recently where it just would not open, or wouldn't record anything. I tried every suggested solution, and was eventually told to try uninstalling the app and reinstalling it. This worked, however it also erased three years of health data I had diligently collected, so I am not very happy.",1
Samsung Health,"Everything was going great until the app was recently updated, whenever I opened up the app today to add in a few items that I have eaten I notice that the weight management that tracks if I'm above or below my calorie limit was gone I found it very frustrating, I reset my account and everything believing that it was a bug but it turned out that it was part of this recent update, I'm sort of disappointed that it took that away because I found it to be one of the most helpful things in the app.",1
Samsung Health,"For the most part I really like the app as it works with my samsung smart watch. However i really hope they make a few changes. 1) be able to search the Fav food items. I eat the same stuff and when i ad it to my favs i have to scroll up and down looking for it and its a pain. 2) be able to edit / delete the My Food entries. If you make a mistake you cant change it or delete it. or at least i can't figure out how. so i create the a new version with same name + 2 3) Bar Code Scanner for nutritional information like every other nutrition app already has. This would be awesome and it already exists in several other apps. 4) expand compatible devices to include scales, and BGM that are available today. I have tried to purchase devices that are compatible but the device list seems to be old. I can't seem to find those exact devices now. 5) better integration with MyFitnessPal. I get a discount on my health insurance if i submit my steps and achieve the goals. But the apps do not seem to be compatible with each other. 6) integrate a web app. would be great to be able to go to a web page and have some reporting, like daily calorie count, step counts, trend etc that i can print so i can take to my Dr. and discuss. On the samsung health website they indicate apps with samsung health and devices with samsung health but there is no links to see what those apps and devices are. I really like having all of the information in one place. there are probably a few more improvements I gave this a 3 star. This app has the potential to be the best app out there. There are other apps that have these features and i am considering going to an iphone and iwatch or fitbit watch to be able to use these features.",3
Samsung Health,"Features were removed during the last update. There is no ""weight management"" tab to keep track of my calories in and calories out. It still remembers my calorie goal under the ""food"" tab, but there is no option to change it based on weekly weight loss goal and exercise. Stupid update. No one cares about the appearance if youre removing features.",1

No one cares about the appearance if youre removing features.",2
Samsung Health,"I had to reinstall and now lost my ECG measurement from available tabs. Also, unless I just don't see it, why can I not see my hourly HR measurements in addition to just daily averages, hi/low?? I'd also like to see my heart rate built in as a viewable option when looking at sleep pattern. Please update so we can expand these views/trends as well.",2
Samsung Health,"Very ordinary fitness tracker. Doesn't even give basics like annual totals for steps, floors etc. Only reason to use is that it's the only one that syncs with Samsung watch As suggested you can go to trends but the only options are days, weeks or months. No annual total or year by year option. Surely anual totals are very important You can go trends but the only option are days, weeks or months. No years.",2
Samsung Health,"I love Samsung and their phones, but I'm very disappointed that you cannot have a connected device (ie Garmin watch) sync data with Samsung Health outside of a Samsung device. They're treading into Apple territory with proprietary functionality. Don't regress Samsung! I've already made a personal ban of Apple products for this exact reason. You're better than this Samsung. Please open the ability to sync from any device, not just your own!",1
Samsung Health,"What happened?! Ever since the last update the app doesn't automatically detect how long I've been asleep! It used to remember when I put my phone down at night and when I picked it up in the morning, but ever since the last update I've had to enter it manually. Very frustrating when an update actually downgrades the features you've gotten used to.",3
Samsung Health,"I have not found an app to do what this one does. It has all the food I can think of from the stores I buy, even any homemade soups, etc. May not be 100% but much closer than any other app & free too. I wish it would link with my cheap tracker since I don't always have my phone on me, but I can live with that. It does help me stay in check at least. I will be sharing this app with siblings struggling with weight during these times...also, I am a senior as are they",5
Samsung Health,"It's the best health app I've found and believe me I've searched a lot. I just have a question. A year ago you had a ""programme"" let's say that measured my calories and my workouts together and told me how much I had to burn or to eat to reach my daily target so as to lose or gain weight in the long run. Did you delete this feature?",5
Samsung Health,"The pedometer is so inaccurate, it's scary. It doesn't always record steps and the discrepancy between and another pedometer app is sometimes more than 1000 steps. Very disappointing. Not worth it. After doing the recommendations of clearing the cache and a force stop, the problem is still not fixed. Disappointing app.",4
Samsung Health,"2 1/2 stars UI is difficult to navigate - I always end up rummaging around to find the setting I need. The step counter counts ~15-20% more steps than I make. There's no weight management. Food items are plentiful, and yet, when I 'm adding to my meals, it's difficult to find what I need. Related to that, there's no barcode scanner for food stuffs.",3
Samsung Health,"Bug Fixes? More bugs more like. Since the update is doesn't record the route taken on the map or only records 1 of say 3 stages... It is slower now too when changing watch faces. why is it when 'a new better version' of an app comes out there are ALWAYS people who say ""it doesn't work properly now"" ..",2
Samsung Health,"Not bad but hoping for more. I recently got the Galaxy watch active 2 and use this with my Samsung Note 10+. At first I was using a Fitbit along with this but wanting to consolidate to one app I chose to go with Samsung health. Overall, the features give me a good amount of information. However I wish it would interact more consistently with MyFitnessPal. Also think Fitbit sleep tracking is far more accurate. I wish I could merge features from both apps!",4
Samsung Health,"Some good features. But errors too. I used app for cycling. Each time I slow down in traffic, it stops tracking and says ""Workout paused"". It resumes tracking only after certain speed is reached again. City traffic wont allow steady speed. We have to factor in the time used in pauses, else average",3
Samsung Health,"I used this app on my old phone and even on there it didn't work every time. Now I switched to a new OS on my phone and it is literally impossible to use. The sign in process simply does not ever complete. It's just loading for ages. Edit: I already tried clearing cache, force stopping and reinstalling the app and restarting my phone even before the reply of the developer and it changed nothing.",2
Samsung Health,"This app is user friendly. You can customize it to your need. It helps you monitor, stress, sleep, heart rate and blood pressure. Follow the instructions and you will have somewhat an accurate result to how this app is designed for your use. I enjoy this app as much as an everyday user. It helps me monitor my calorie intake, (not that I am worried, it gives me an idea of what I am eating and how much I should be eating more of.)",5
Samsung Health,"Simply doesn't work anymore! I have a Huawei phone but a Samsung smartwatch. I rarely go into the app but wanted to check some stats from a few recent runs. The app won't even open, I've uninstalled but still no joy. I then found out if you press and hold the app icon and select the steps it can show you the steps screen, but the main dashboard in the app is totally broken for me. Renders the app useless!",2
Samsung Health,"That's a very great app for recording daily activities and basic gym exercises, but it'll be very great if it has the ability to record every sort of gym workout with my Galaxy Watch, if the watch doesn't support recording these advanced activities, make it just record the heart rate and we can enter the reps and weights manually. Thank You",3
Samsung Health,"Used to work well, but recent update seems to have screwed it so it now does not display any data. It keeps counting steps, but doesn't display them until I force-stop the app and restart it. I'm now having to do that virtually every day. Please fix this. Update following Samsung response: Please provide a UK number.",1
Samsung Health,"Ruined after update. I used this specifically for how much sleep I've had. This function/ display appears to have been removed for some bizarre reason! Absolutely of no use to me anymore as it no longer does what I was using it for every day. Common theme, everytime anyone updates an app they ruin it, will now be deleted as its of no use to me. Samsung please look at all the bad reviews since the update and use your brains...your customers really don't like it, wake up!",1
Samsung Health,"I'll go for a run, it will record it. But for some reason doesnt upload the run to the app. It will upload a different workout afterwards but just won't accept the run. Rebooting the galaxy fit erases the run and its gone. Makes trying to use the app to track certain things useless. Same issues with auto workouts as always. Going for a ride on my motorcycle triggers a bike ride. Using a Samsung galaxy fit with a Samsung s20 ultra phone. So I dont think its using a competing phone thats problem",1
Samsung Health,Horrible update. It is using too much phone battery now. My phone is now overheating due to this app. It is using 14% of my CPU and says it needs to be closed. I have had to uninstall it. It is no longer syncing to Myfitnesspal. People use this to accurately monitor calories in order to lose weight. Do not take that function away. This is a very large consumer dissatisfier. Please fix ASAP! There has been a large issue with every update which is unacceptable.,1
Samsung Health,"This used to work well. Now for the past month or so the app is no longer counting my steps accurately. I've been up and around since 7 am and my counter is stuck on 15 steps. I haven't met my daily step goal in over a month because something changed within the app. Yesterday I was stuck on 2583 steps for most of the day and didn't realize the app had stopped counting sometime in the early afternoon. What happened, Samsung??",3
Samsung Health,"Great app can be fantastic with: 1. Ability to adjust daily macronutrient percentages for fat, carbs and protein and weekly trend. 2. Ability to track net carbohydrates and overall weekly trend. 3. Ability to track net calories at end of each day and overall weekly trend. 4. Ability to input meal data for next day to plan ahead. 5. Ability to scan food barcode for meal inputs. 6. A better list of macro nutrient breakdown. 7. Track fasting periods and weekly trend",3

Samsung Health,"I used to love the step-tracking widget, but they ruined it. The previous version had a big, beautiful step counter centered in the widget and the new one is left-justified and super tiny. All the info on the widget can fit in three squares (two w/o the heart monitor button), but the smallest you can make the widget is four squares. You're also forced to display the goal now too, which is especially discouraging during this pandemic. Bleh.",1
Samsung Health,"Functional Changes to Samsung Health makes this app less than desirable and not as useful. Yes. It is nice to use the Galaxy Watch, but it was a great advantage to have the ability to use both. My Galaxy Watch sensor is not working so I loved how my Galaxy Note would capture my pulse, measure stress, and Auto detect a workout [my favorite] are all gone from the Galaxy Note. This is why I don't like to get use to using Samsung related apps because I understand you move Development Teams off.",2
Samsung Health,"Not impressed. Does a poor job counting steps (and mileage UNLESS engaged in an activity which uses GPS). I turned off ""auto-detect"" workout since it was terrible - thought I was swimming when working out on treadmill and only detected 11 minutes of a one hour session. Seems to detect sleep reasonably well - except for deep sleep which it seems largely insensitive to. While I appreciate other functionality of the App (heart rate, stress, spaO2), it is difficult to know how accurate these are when I know the other functionality is not even close. (BTW: I tested the app against both my treadmill display and my Polar Vantage M and the later two were much more closely aligned in terms of steps and distance than either was to the Samsung Health output which was both many steps and miles behind)",2

Samsung Health,"**Update**I got a quick reply, cleared out the cache and now its working again!! Thank you!! Major Disappointment!! Lately my Samsung Health app has been terrible. When I open it up, it never gets past the screen where the three guys are walking. So many of my workouts haven't been recorded because of it. I'm so disappointed, I love Samsung Health! Lately though not so much!!",5
Samsung Health,"Since the update it has been using extreme battery life compared to prior to the update. In addition while out for a,walk and walking at a good pace it continuously goes into pause mode. Again this did not happen prior to this update. I am not happy with this app right now. Please so another update",1
Samsung Health,"I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving",5
Samsung Health,"I use to really like this app because of the ease of use and the immediate ability to measure heartrate, oxygen level stress among other things. Now this updated version has removed that option. I assume its because some people have smart watches and sync them with this app. What about those of us who have zero desire to get a smart watch or Fitbit? Now we dont have that immediate availability to measure important vital statistics related to our health. That's not fair!! Please return that optio",2
Samsung Health,"Good. It is getting better, but I but still no match for the information display Garmin gives in regard to runs. It's awesome for tracking calories. They need to add sex as a workout choice though, let's just be real, we all do it, and it counts towards fitness and overall wellness.",4
Samsung Health,"Says access denied when I try to open the app. I have tried everything with Samsung support team and it still doesn't work. I bought a Samsung phone (s9) and watch (galaxy watch 3) so I didn't have to worry about things like this it's pretty terrible that I can't even open Samsung health... In reply to below: yes I have tried clearing the cache, the cache partition, reinstalling and many other things. You leave a number to call but it is a US number so I can't call it! How to contact from UK?",1
Samsung Health,"Loved using the app but all of a sudden all of my progress since June has been erased. All my steps, exercise, sleep tracker, etc. It shows my total steps since I began using the app, but everything that shows that progress is gone from before October. My phone hasn't changed or been reset and I've always had auto sync enabled. I'm very confused and disappointed. Like the app other than this.",5
Samsung Health,"Love this app! It starts automatically as you start moving and love adding my food intake, along with water and heart rate. The one thing they could improve is the food information; either too many similar options (ie muffin, chocolate muffin, choco muffin, etc) which is confusing or can't find the .",4
Samsung Health,"I really loved this for the step counter. I enjoyed the counting calories and seeing the nutrient intake, but it is not accurate. I have noticed several items without the correct counts or it will say 0 and there will be an actual decent amount. I can't figure out how to report the issues to fix it",3
Samsung Health,"No other app could've made me happier! I've been using the Huawei Health for a year now, but I changed my fitness watch and experienced a culture shock after I used Samsung Health! It's fantastic! I'm absolutely happy with how comprehensive it is. It spared me the trouble of downloading multiple apps by having everything I need! I salute you, creators! You did your job well! Thank you!",5
Samsung Health,"Honestly, they had one good feature, weight and calorie intake management, and now that's gone. You could have just made that thing optional. It was the reason I was using Samsung health. if I have to use two or three apps for my health tracking, it's not worth it. I'll probably end up using another app with weight management features as my main app. Sucks that my gear sport works only with this app otherwise I would uninstall it",1
Samsung Health,"Absolute rubbish....!!. Steps NEVER count properly. Read up on a few threads online about the same problem, many many people having the same problem !. I have a brand new S10 and would expect it to work effectively !. I have checked the app settings, the power settings etc and chaged it not to go to sleep, works for a while and then stops.I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app.The only solution I found that works is restarting the phone, but even then after a while it stops again, have had to restart the phone at least twice a day, which I am not willing to keep doing to a new phone !!!. Even though I would walk a lot daily during this lockdown, the app only registers about 400-800 steps daily. I have uninstalled the app and will never use it again, if it was possible to give it ZERO stars i would...!!!",1
Samsung Health,"It is awful. Polar sync is not working. Submitted a ticket for that, received a notification with a reply, but, believe me or not, if you swipe it accidentally, you will not be able to open it. So I have a reply on my case, but I can not even see it. Apart from that, Yunmay sync is not working even though I granted all required permissions. Was it tested at all? I doubt that. You better spend more time on quality of a smaller number of features rather than poorly tested big number of them.",1
Samsung Health,"I used your app daily throughout the summer. I dropped 40 lbs. Then you just released an update which removed the one feature that helped me achieve this, the weight management widget. Why would you remove the most effective weight loss tool? It literally sets you apart from other tracker apps. Now you're just a conduit for my watch to tell MyFitnessPal my workouts. I'll check back next update and if that widget is back, I'll think about using your app again. At this point, there's no reason to.",2
Samsung Health,The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.,2
Samsung Health,"A great app, indeed. I use it to keep track of my exercises and food intake. I just wish I could choose how many ml each glass of water has, it would be extremely more convenient for me and other users, I believe. There's only the 250 ml option, but the glass I use to drink water has 400 ml.",5
Samsung Health,"So I'm not sure if others are experiencing this as well but for the last couple of days this hasn't been recording my steps at all and I'm getting quite annoyed by it. I have another app that also has a pedometer on it but it was good to have both picking up steps as they weren't always in sync and so I could work out an average from them both. But as I said, this is now not happening and its frustrating as this is what I mostly use this app for...",2
Samsung Health,Good app but had flaws. Especially with sleep tracker. The workout tracking works great including with a GPS route on runs. With the sleep tracker it doesn't show a request to log sleep hours everytime you sleep and sometimes doesn't display your auto sleep and wake time on the app especially when sleeping on night shift. It seems like the app is intended to work with a wake-in-the-morning sleep schedule it doesn't seem to work as well with night shift sleep schedule,3
Samsung Health,"Eh, its okay but missing a lot of activities while synced with a watch. I have a Samsung active 2 watch and the workout tracker is helpful, but extremely disappointing in terms of available activities to track. I am extremely athletic, I lift weights (not only machines) Olympic weight lifting, crossfit, rock climbing, sprinting, polymerics, HIIT..... the app has no settings for these types of exercises.... so I find it wildly inaccurate at ""tracking my activity",2
Samsung Health,I've been using Samsung health app for years and decided to update it so that it can link to my other apps. The update straight up sucks! It does NOT have the wait maintenance section in the app anymore. It's very limited and the information that is linked to the other app does not come through correctly. I wish I didn't update. Two thumbs DOWN!!!,1
Samsung Health,The most usefull part about this app was the weight management feature. I came back to this app after a whole 3 months to go after my basic routine only to find out the feature was taken out in an update. Samsung please return the weight management feature. You'll get a better review once you've brought back this feature. A lot of your customers look after it. Hoping to seeing this feature in a soon update,2
Samsung Health,"Extremely bad new version. Why do I need this Application if it doesn't count calories spent vs calories taken? Heart rate, steps and activity can count any fitness watch, even the cheapest and the oldest. And this version of Application is useless. Waiting till the next update, and if doesn't change- I'll have to change the Application and maybe also the devices.",1
Samsung Health,"No longer syncs steps and activity with MyFitnessPal. Under Armour (Who own MFP) have said that this is an issue with Samsung Health, and not their app. Very disappointing as this used to work. I can see by other reviews that I'm not alone in experiencing these problems. Please fix this Samsung, and I will change my review.",1
Samsung Health,Seriously disappointed. I got this app with my smartwatch and originally and it had weight management which tracked your activity versus your calorie intake. They've removed this feature and it seriously takes away from the function that was the primary reason I purchased the watch. Removing this health and weight inclusive feature was a very poor decision on Samsung's part. The app is basically useless at this point. I could have bought a cheap pedometer. Put it back.,1
Samsung Health,"Unable to use Heart rate sensor blood oxygen level stress level, On Galaxy S20 ultra, Don't seem to have a sensor anymore!! It works fine with my other phones I'm thinking it might be the ultra. Besides steps, does this app work on S20 ultra, My question was answered it is the phone it doesn't have a sensor anymore From S10 plus up That's a shame On Samsung's behalf😔😔😔

Samsung Health,I have a Samsung S3 watch connected to an LG v50 phone. About eight months ago it stopped calculating my stairs climbed. I work in construction and I am up and down the ladder all day and up and down stairs walking through buildings. The last time I calculated any stairs was a month ago and before that it had gone for months saying I had not gone up even one flight of stairs. I have two flights of stairs in my house and go up and down them all the time. It's incredibly annoying do not have this.,2
Samsung Health,"Compared to me using Apple Watch, iPhone and the Apple Health, Samsung has a different approach which makes it way ahead than the apples. Here is why. To use the Samsung Health eco system, you just need a smartphone. Even an iPhone in your pocket can enable every feature of this advanced sports and health monitoring app whether you have a Samsung watch, fitness band. challenge friends and family for the steps you take, or compete for ranking and completion of monthly challenges and what not",5
Samsung Health,"Confusing, not user friendly, tiny font point, no flexibility, lost my data, etc etc etc. Sleep tracking occasionally gives me a block graph instead of sleep cycle details. I contacted tech support 6x and no department would handle my call. App support just kept looping me around to departments.",1
Samsung Health,"These best function for me was weight management. Based on my personal data, I could monitor my close to actual metabolic rate- it also synced with my watch so I could glance and know where I was for the day regarding calories in vs. burned. The function is good for losing, gaining or maintaining weight. Unfortunately, this function was removed from the app in the last update. So I find the app not nearly as useful as it was.",1
Samsung Health,"Doubles the number of steps by counting the steps recorded by the mobile and adding the steps recorded by watch active 2 too. The software should be such that if same steps are recorded by both devices at the same time, only the set of steps from the watch or the average of both should be calculated. How can Samsung allow such errors...? Instead the Samsung health app just tells us that you don't have an option to count steps only from your watch active 2. Then why buy such costly watches?",4
Samsung Health,"What happened to be able to record Oxygen Levels & Stress Levels? This was such a helpful app, now all I can record is my weight & bp. (I only used 4 options).UPDATE: Response email to their response:""Um, I live in the States. And there isn't anything for the Stress, but I am more concerned about my Oxygen.By the looks of ALL the recent negative reviews (not many positive ones) 88.2% of users are NOT happy with this update.Why break something that was working GREAT?"" I think app will be deleted.",2
Samsung Health,"I used to use this app all the time and absolutely loved it. But I think it must have auto updated in the last month or two, and it is now seriously inaccurate (it underestimates by a lot) for distance covered which is all I use it for. I really want to use it to measure the distance walked and don't know how to rectify it. Any suggestions? Thanks.",3
Samsung Health,"I love the app, but I would like to suggest something. I'm getting my steps in, but I think that if you want to give more incentive, rather than giving earnings after 10,000 steps, how about every 1,200? Like maybe $5 for every 1,200 steps, perhaps. I'm not sure what you think about it, but it's a great incentive to get walking more. I like the idea of earning while I do what I do every day. My wife & I compare our steps & distance walked every day, it's a lot of fun for us. Thanks for your time",5
Samsung Health,Wouldn't let me look at my challenges. Kept saying I had to verify my identity. Then I kept having to change my login to get in and it still wouldn't take me to challenges. Had to change my login agaoan and again. Worthless site once you are on it. It doesn't serve its purpose. All my information erased when I tried to reinstall it(thought that might help) This was the best app before any changes. Ugh! I also used this to track my BP and weight loss. Frustrating when it was working fine before.,3
Samsung Health,"Edit: support team was so quick to suggest the solution here I'm thoroughly impressed! Thanks, will try it out! Original review: The app is great overall unfortunately not free of bugs. I did a run in the morning and walk in the afternoon. All the data is available on both watch and app, but only the afternoon walk counts towards the daily fitness goal. In the app the step and calorie counter show the time when I was running as blank",5
Samsung Health,"confusing interface and bugs. I bought the Samsung Galaxy fit 2 and connected it to the app. 1) you can't adjust the length of your step. Hence in my case for example it lowers the speed and distance by 20%, which is unusable. 2) there was a coffee cups counter widget. After I connected the band, it disappeared. 3) poor connectivity with Strava. I did 2 walks. I recorded one manually and another one automatically. The app merged them into one and send to Strava with errors.",3
Samsung Health,"So 👎. The Samsung Health App and Samsung Fit e do not work well together. The Fit e records data and pulse incorrectly, and gives bad data. Example, cardio, my heart rate measured was 151, Samsung was recording it at....75. No amount of restarting sorted this out, and it is happening more frequently. Do not get a Fit e to pair it with the Health app",1
Samsung Health,"Samsung Health export to Strava much better now. Samsung Health exports to Strava, but randomly. But now it only supports Samsung devices eg Galaxy watch, it used to support my Wahoo HRM. Google fit is the same, only supports wear OS devices. So I now use a Wahoo health app which sync's to Strava ",3
Samsung Health,I use this with the Samsung watch. I like the fact that it gives me the ability to track data throughout the day and see what my trends look like. I do wish that there was a barcode scanner to enter food. I also wish you could add supplements and prescriptions to your nutrient list separate from your food. For example simply programming and my daily pills as a meal. The truth of the matter is I am a chef and cook a lot of my meals from scratch which makes it very difficult to enter them into the food data for my daily meals. It would be nice if there was a way to enter the entire amount that I cooked as a dish and then they portion of that dish that I ate as a meal.,5
Samsung Health,i luv that the fact that it is already preinstalled in the samsung galaxy phones. the step counter is VERY useful. not alot of the health websites sync with samsung & i HATED entering it manually so i bought a samsung gear so my steps always count. I also use the weight & food tracker....i just wished they would have a note section for each food u track. for example...i might get 4 stacks of pancake but only ate 2 with syrup & butter. i kno u can enter it manually but if it's already there.,5
Samsung Health,"It sucks for counting your steps now, it was only counting about every fourth step I took so I didn't get a star for the monthly challenge but it sure does count 1 step as 100 for other people. The monthly challenges are annoying because they allow so many people to cheat. They should be able to tel...",1
Samsung Health,"This is a very good app. Especially in this age it has most everything. It tracks activities, food/drink, sleep and for me most important - BP, HR, Glucose, and O2. I just wish it had temperature and an easy way to export it to excel or such. Then it would be perfect.",4
Samsung Health,This went from being one of my favorite apps to being the absolute worse. It is constantly crashing! The steps are not being counted correctly and my data from previous days has disappeared! What the heck happened with the last update! I am super upset and disappointed. Fix it already!,1
Samsung Health,"I truly enjoyed this app. All of a sudden, (within the last 2 weeks) when I open the app, it shuts down and I end up on my home page. I refreshed my phone, (Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plys) keep turning it off and then turn it back on, to no avail. Please help me out",3
Samsung Health,"My favorite free calorie and fitness app, hands down. I've used them all. Of course noom and ww are best... but with a pricetag. For maintenance or when you don't need that extra push, this is perfect. Tried my fitness pal could not stand the constant interruptions pushing for upgrade- made very difficult to use. This interface is great, tracks steps, food diary is very intuitive, as is the ability to add activities, everything in one place.",5
Samsung Health,"I don't want to take away from the positives this app brings. However, I don't understand why the data you're collecting and saving can't be viewed using different metrics. For one, an average distance for the month is of no real use to me personally. However, total distance in that month would b",4

Samsung Health,Downloaded Samsung Health when I purchased Watch Active2 10/4/20 hoping to get the much long awaited ECG and Blood Pressure Monitoring functions. Only to find out that these functions will Not work on a non Samsung Android phone. I will wait 30 more days for a software update that will load these two features on my Android phone before I return the Watch Active2 for a refund. Very disappointed so far!! Hopefully resolved soon or class action suit should follow,1
Samsung Health,"When I owned a Samsung S10e the app worked and did what I wanted (albeit with ads). Now on a Pixel 4XL and I simply cannot login no matter how many times try different ways. Giving 3 star because it does what needs to on Samsung phones, but could improve in a number of ways then dropping a star for login in problems on other phones",2
Samsung Health,"Updated 11/5/20 I'm not liking that my workouts aren't being tracked correctly and showing up on my app. I have 4 workouts this week that include a few runs and they aren't showing up which then affects how my fitness pal app calculates how many calories I'm allowed. Previous: I like the various workout options but what I looooved about the Fitbit app was that I can scan a good product and it would pop up for food logging. This app doesn't have that, you have to manually enter the items :/",3
Samsung Health,"I have just changed my phone from an S8 to an A90. I had loads of features on my S8 which I used almost daily, Heart Rate monitor, blood oxygen level and stress monitor. However these features have been removed and I am disappointed by this. I have given it 2 stars as it has kept some of the previous features but the features I used the most have been removed. I am seriously thinking of going back to my S8",2
Samsung Health,"The app is overall good, it works fine to me. Step counting is perfect, auto sleeping data update is almost accurate. Nonetheless I can't give 5 star because of a poor thing. This app automatically doesn't count any satires even their is no data inputs option in manually. I think this thing should be fixed at the earliest.",3
Samsung Health,"It lost my steps. It'd count them during the day but at the end of the day, they'd disappear (wouldn't show up in trends). Reinstalling didn't fix it. It eventually started working again on the Nov 1st without me doing anything. I lost a streak of about 3 months and thus stopped using it. It's still installed, but I don't trust it anymore to keep track of my steps.",3
Samsung Health,"Keeps crushing on huawei p30 pro. Contacted support serveral times, they suggested usual practice with rebooting, clearin cache and data but nothing seems to work. Thinking to return my galaxy watch 3 since I payed so much for a product that don't have half of the apps working ",1
Samsung Health,"Every update fixes less issues then it introduces. Wonder if there is any kind of quality assurance or customer feedback noted. There are countless reviews saying ""Removal of weight management has made the app useless"". However the developers neither provide a reason nor an assurance for it to be ba",1
Samsung Health,Honestly about 2 weeks ago I would have given this app 5 star. But ever since I updated and lost weight management I barely use it anymore. I was finally able to lose weight in a healthy and functional manner but now with it gone I'm better off paying for and using other apps at this point.,3
Samsung Health,"Stress meter cannot be trusted; I'm often under a lot of stress but the stress rating can be anywhere from high to low, with no real correlation. Also apparently the ""real"" reason they removed the standalone SpO2 reading could be that the reading I get can vary just by how I put my finger on the sensor. Especially lousy now that we are in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, where a major symptom of being infected is a significant drop in blood oxygen",4
Samsung Health,"This used to be a good app. The last update ruined it. Don't know what they did, but it hangs on the splash screen more often than not. When it does work, it frequently stops working mid-workout. Lost 3500 steps yesterday, and today a 50-mile bike ride vanished. 274 active minutes",1
Samsung Health,"This used to be a great app. This app, connected to my Active Watch 2 and myfitnesspal, helped me to lose a third of my body weight - and more recently has been helping me to learn to balance calories more naturally. The latest updates have removed the calorie tracker and the link to myfitnesspal which makes this app useless and myfitnesspal far less useful. Don't waste your money on a samsung watch - a garmin or fitbit are probably the better choice now. Very disappointed in samsung.
",1
Samsung Health,"Does not always accurately count steps. Will stop counting and then resume but with many missed steps in between. For example, worked in my yard yesterday for about 30 minutes, registered that I had only walked 22 steps. Stayed on 22 for at least 3 minutes of walking, and then it kicked in. This morning walked about 5 minutes before it moved from 0.
",2
Samsung Health,Bought the Active 2 watch to monitor and track my fitness and exercise. Started off great but then...my workouts would randomly get deleted from my watch...annoying! After that my weekly summary stopped displaying my weekly activity and trends...disappointing! Then Samsung decided that it should stop tracking burned calories altogether!!! Why on earth would you create an update that omits a calories burned tracker from an ACTIVITY WATCH??? I'm am beyond disappointed and frustrated!,1
Samsung Health,"Hi 👋 I love the App, but I think is unfortunate that so many people cheat on the global challenges and nothing is done about it 😕 The November challenge started today and the leader board has people who walked over 110000 steps in only 18 hours, how is this even possible? The other thing I find upsetting is login in the food, like if I put milk it doesn't show that there is any calcium on it, but milk does have calcium hey! Please, make sure the food's nutrition info are up to date. Thanks 😊",2
Samsung Health,"This last update changed the app to stop counting steps and I'm furious after 11 straight months of using it. All of a sudden. It's specifically effecting the steps counted because it's still lapsing time correctly, but my steps have been cut in half. I've force stopped it, turned counting steps off and on, deleted and and then I redownload the app, I've cleared the cache. Nothing. And I can't undo the stupid update. Terrible. I'd give it zero stars. Currently looking for a new health app.",1
Samsung Health,"I've been using the Samsung health app for a few days (properly, since its always been on my samsung phones) since get a Active2 watch. Its quite a good little app, quite similar to fitbit app in many ways. The only thing I think that would make it a 5 star app for me, would be if there was a dashboard for PC/Mac/tablet devices that I could log into and see information better. E.g. in the app I haven't found a way to tap on a daily HR monitor graph to see what the values were. Just a thought",4
Samsung Health,"I like this app a lot, but I've removed 1 Star because with a recent update, there's now a non-removable advert for Glow Premium Menstrual Tracker on the top of my home screen. I have my personal details logged in the app correctly, so this ad is not relevant to me as a bio male. I wish that I could either have the option to remove/change it manually or, failing that, see a suggested ad for something that is targeted to me specifically based on my personal info that I have entered in the app",4
Samsung Health,For most items I can manually input the info. Pulse is only from my Gear S3.and that is the only health metric it sends to my phone Blood Oxygen is not available anywhere. Stress is just a STATIC display last updated OCT 27. My new Note 20 Ultra is not able to give my the health information I need.in this era of Covid-19 O2 is a key warning element. My Omron BP786 will not connect to this APP I have to manually input the data. .,3
Samsung Health,"I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended ""fixes"" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again.",3
Samsung Health,"I *was* very happy with this app, especially after purchasing a Samsung Active 2 to pair with it. Now, I'm BEYOND upset that the steps no longer sync to My FitnessPal AND, as of this morning, the detailed sleep analysis is GONE. What is going over there, Samsung? Please get it together. I didn't purchase an Active 2 to serve as a glorified bracelet.",1
Samsung Health,"I don't know what is going on with this APP, I used to love it, but from a while ago it's affecting my steps when I do a challenge, if I lose it cut my steps like in 15k or 20k. Mean they don't update or sync properly which is very frustrating. Challenges are for motivation and encouragement and when you see your steps missing, YOU JUST WANT TO STOP DOING CHALLENGES. What is going on SH? Please do things right and update on time without cutting steps",2
Samsung Health,I like using this app but I swear every update makes it harder to delete sleep records. My Galaxy Fit gets my evening routine confused with sleep a lot so I go back at some point and clean up the records but the delete option is pushed into more menus every time. Only downside I've noticed from casual use so keep up the good work,2
Samsung Health,I reviewed this app about 2 year ago and gave it 3 stars. I stopped using it for a while even. I resumed using it about 6 months ago and am very pleased with the updates. I am enjoying the added features as well as the improved accuracy with keeping up with my activity.,4
Samsung Health,"Overall I enjoy the app but the last week I have constant trouble with the app not opening. It initially loads then just closes pretty much straight away. I have restarted my phone, cleared the data and cache on the app as well as tried skipping the sign up process. This works for a while but then the next day it fails to open again. I am using on a Huawei P30 Pro.",3
Samsung Health,"Pointless, worthless ads cluttering the screen ... The app does contain ads. The description in Google Play says it contains ads. I can supply screen shots if there is an email address or similar for this. A US phone number is not much use. Nor is a ""noreply"" email Still getting ads (Sept 30) e. g. Get a 75 voucher when you join Bulb today. Screen shot available. Received the same worthless automated response as before. Quite clearly the app does show ads. Google play agrees with me.",1
Samsung Health,"Step count horribly wrong, 4956 steps in a 1600sq/ft home while never leaving the house while playing on my computer all day... Man I'm super healthy 💪. Also what happened to sleep tracking. This app can't seem to figure out that I work at night and sleep during the day. Come on. No. Fix the app",1
Samsung Health,"This app worked great until the last update! I can now no longer see any sleep details, it just suggests times to record manually, but no detail like it used to have.

Samsung Health,"I had your app since I had a Samsung phone, your app was good back then. Since the removal of certain features it has gone down hill. Now you have changed the size of the widget for step counts, it it small. If you can't fix the problem to your application than I need to fine a better one. Please bring back your old version with stress, heart beat, oxygen level.",1
Samsung Health,"I started using this app a few months ago. Even though i still find it usefull in some ways the best feature was removed. This being the weight management tool that was built into the app. Then caffeine counter was nice too, but losing the weight management function basically basically just turned it into a pedometer that you can also track your food in. Also I've noticed there are a large selection of specific foods that are not in the calorie counter widget.",2
Samsung Health,"I have been using this app for several years. Within the past few months an update changed the available data which was disappointing. It still tracks most things but I liked seeing more data regarding calories. But on the bright side, the tracking of sleep is automated and very accurate.",4
Samsung Health,"-0 Since I wrote this review there has not been any change. I miss the old one that had everything useful to EVERYONE. I thought it was a 5 star for years. This new one is horrid! Does not have other options. I cannot set weight loss and calories set to lose; also, I cannot know if I am under, over or GOOD. Also the colours are not good for me because I cannot see the shades. I liked the drastic colour bars before. Please bring the old one again. This is no used to me",1
Samsung Health,"For last 4 days daily step count has not been stored into ""trends"" at the end of day. Phone is Samsung A50. Have tried everything. Clear cache, reinstall app, etc,etc. Update: You have sent response which is obviously automatic standard response as I have tried everything you suggest. I told you this in my original enquiry above. Also trying to ring a US number and no response is useless from Australia. Just fix the app",2
Samsung Health,"I used this app for quite a while to track everything; my activity level, caloric intake, weight loss (and some weight gain), and vitamin and mineral levels. I feel that the app played a very crucial role in helping me lose over 60 pounds and keep it off. My only recommendation is that you should input the nutritional information for the foods you eat yourself instead of the information already in the app, and I think going through that process also helps you be moreaware of what you're eating.",5
Samsung Health,"The new widget display shows smaller numbers and there appears to be no way to change it. It seems it takes much longer for the steps to update. Quite often, if I tap on it to open the app, the screen stays white and does nothing. I have to restart my phone. Not happy with the latest update! Wow",1
Samsung Health,This app again stopped working I don't even know what is happening with this have it worked like 2 month really well and stopped working from yesterday. Please give an update and fixed bug as soon as possible. This apps helps me a huge but right now I can't even use it. I went for a walk like 8,4
Samsung Health,"Was my favourite health app since long time and i was using it perfectly with gear fit 2 pro,, just now updated to galaxy watch active 2 and surprised that in recent updates they removed important features like weight management which makes the application only just a tracker for heart rate and weight without monitoring and coaching. If this feature back i will give it 5 stars",2
Samsung Health,I love the app and use it daily. Not sure why but my step history for last three days is gone from trends. I still see daily activity trends for my active minutes but nothing for steps. It is obviously impacting my weekly and monthly averages as well. Not sure how to fix. Thanks.,5
Samsung Health,"Why can't I see monthly calendar view of my daily activity hearts, to see how many days I completed the hearts?

Samsung Health,"I am truly disappointed with this app and have been actively looking for a new app and even a new watch to go with it. They took weight management section away which helped me pay attention to my calories burned and how much more I needed to do to meet my goals.

Samsung Health,"None of the features they say work on Canada except heart rate. So don't buy a Samsung watch of you want EKG or blood pressure or stress monitor or anything if you live in Canada. Buy an Apple watch. They work in Canada with all the features. Samsung has been lying about this for years and keep saying ""we are working on it"" but nothing ever comes of it",1
Samsung Health,"Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂

Samsung Health,"I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Active watch and am trying to register for Samsung Health for it. It will not let me sign in. I just keep getting the circle to indicate its doing something but never actually does. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous times, turned my phone on and off numerous times, as I have for the watch. No matter what it will not proceed to sign in. Can you help please?",1
Samsung Health,"10 flights of stairs never registered! It counted the steps I took but it did not register any of the flights of stairs that I took. I walked up 10 stories, flights of stairs, and then back down and check my progress only to find out it never registered. However it did count the steps that I took. So the app was working but only part of it. I live in FL, we don't have hills. So to walk up 10 flights of stairs we actually need to walk up actual stairs in a building.",2
Samsung Health,"I have been using this for several years. Tracking for walks always shows weak gps signal since upgrade to Note 10. The further I upgrade phone the less functionality I get. No more oxygen sensor, sleep monitoring etc. Phone features are getting hobbled so Samsung can sell some watches?

Samsung Health,"Loved using this app in the past but since the ladt update there seems to be a major bug. I'm using the app on a Huawei phone, and the moment I open the app and it starts loading the app completely crashes.

Samsung Health,08/29/2020 I was very happy with the features until the recent update. The weight management feature disappeared totally. I referenced it several times through the day in conjunction with monitoring my activity and food intake. Please bring it back. Also my watch battery is draining rapidly since this update. Update as of 11/1/20. Now the weekly summary disappeared after 10/17. Still no weight mgmt and battery life still terrible. Please fix.,2
Samsung Health,"Since the update it has been using extreme battery life compared to prior to the update. In addition while out for a,walk and walking at a good pace it continuously goes into pause mode. Again this did not happen prior to this update. I am not happy with this app right now. Please so another update asap to fix these issues",1
Samsung Health,"I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in ""good"" for calorie intake.",5
Samsung Health,"Good. It is getting better, but I but still no match for the information display Garmin gives in regard to runs. It's awesome for tracking calories. They need to add sex as a workout choice though, let's just be real, we all do it, and it counts towards fitness and overall wellness.",4

Samsung Health,"I really loved this for the step counter. I enjoyed the counting calories and seeing the nutrient intake, but it is not accurate.

Samsung Health,"I used your app daily throughout the summer. I dropped 40 lbs. Then you just released an update which removed the one feature that helped me achieve this, the weight management widget. Why would you remove the most effective weight loss tool? It literally sets you apart from other tracker apps. Now you're just a conduit for my watch to tell MyFitnessPal my workouts. I'll check back next update and if that widget is back, I'll think about using your app again. At this point, there's no reason to.",2

Samsung Health,"Doubles the number of steps by counting the steps recorded by the mobile and adding the steps recorded by watch active 2 too. The software should be such that if same steps are recorded by both devices at the same time, only the set of steps from the watch or the average of both should be calculated. How can Samsung allow such errors...? Instead the Samsung health app just tells us that you don't have an option to count steps only from your watch active 2. Then why buy such costly watches?",1

Samsung Health,"It sucks for counting your steps now, it was only counting about every fourth step I took so I didn't get a star for the monthly challenge but it sure does count 1 step as 100 for other people. The monthly challenges are annoying because they allow so many people to cheat. They should be able to tell that someone who gets 150,000 steps in a day is cheating. I'm no longer going to use this app.",1
Samsung Health,"This is a very good app. Especially in this age it has most everything. It tracks activities, food/drink, sleep and for me most important - BP, HR, Glucose, and O2. I just wish it had temperature and an easy way to export it to excel or such. Then it would be perfect.",4

Samsung Health,"I don't want to take away from the positives this app brings. However, I don't understand why the data you're collecting and saving can't be viewed using different metrics. For one, an average distance for the month is of no real use to me personally. However, total distance in that month would be incredibly useful to say ""you've done x miles this month"" because that would be really useful to have something to work towards. Do you know if this feature is something we can expect? Thanks!",4
Samsung Health,"Absolutely the worst fitness app. Too bad I'd spent big monies for Samsung Watches (two of them) yet over the last few years, it's app is woefully inadequate.

Also it doesn't pick up all the times you are up at night or for how long. I was up for 2hrs 40min in the early morning and the app says I slept straight through! Between last night and early morning I got up 5 times, the app shows nothing of that, according to the app I slept straight through.",1

Also it says it has trip detection, again.",2
Samsung Health,"The most recent update (August 5th) removed the section that told you how many calories you had burned each day. I don't understand why this was removed. There is still a section that says ""aim for a ____ calorie deficit,"" but what is the point of that if I can't check to see what I burned on previo.",1
Samsung Health,"Worse and worse Agreed, each time they do it they make it worse - The last update now means that while it's kind enough to count steps it won't keep them in history. It's also perpetually running ads about monitoring my menstrual cycle which as 55 year old man I do not require since I am decidedly post menopausal. It's also no longer possible to sync it with the Qantas app. Use Google fit, it's better",1
Samsung Health,"Not sure if this update is an improvement or what is going on. Cycling for 1 hr 40 mins yesterday and showed 5 miles per hour average. Compared to others in the ride group way too low, by 1/3 actual average. Still request a suggested improvement that I made more than 1 year back. If you start another activity like cycling, skiing, etc then the steps count should be stopped until finished (or at least prompt and ask if steps should pause) Should not have to pause steps count, then when finished",2

Samsung Health,"The features in this app are great, BUT. When I go on walks, even though I keep my phone in my hands. It does not even come close to being accurate. I walked for two miles and the app says I only walked 37 steps. Even though it did track my route. I miss my Fitbit so bad.",1
Samsung Health,I still daily uae this app while all my needs are not covered. I wish to see my stats (including lifetime distance or steps) on a computer screen. There's no way to see my lifetime steps or distance walked. No website platform to view total carbs consumed in a year or widgets on Android etc,2
Samsung Health,Been using this app for the last 3.5 years and this latest update changed the step counter making it tiny and the one before got rid of pulse check and the heart rate monitor is a joke. And now as of this last update it no longer syncs up to mtfitnesspal to track my steps which synced with my trainerize app. I cannot manually add my steps to either app. So this app has become pointless to me now and a waste of space. Stop trying to fix things that aren't broken you just break them then.,1
Samsung Health,"Nice app, I like that I have my training (walking, running) and my food diet easy trackable. I found everything and I have managed to lose almost 7 kg in 10 days. It helps me to focus with a small goals. Very nice feature is auto stop and start when training and works just perfect. I'm very happy and I wish a day to have the possibility to add a Samsung smart watch. Thank you Samsung.",5
Samsung Health,I find this app useful overall. I wonder why there is no feature of racquet sports like badminton on the Samsung gear watch but there is such feature on the Samsung health app. The reading don't tally at all. Hope this can be something to look at. As I am looking forward to a wearable that sync my racquet sports to track my activities. Thank you,3
Samsung Health,"I love the challenges this app does every month. I like how you can keep track of your sleep, calorie intake, coffee as well as your water intake. What I don't like about this app is when I bought a new phone it lost my account. I had to start all over and my progress was lost. That is why I only give it a three star.",3
Samsung Health,I like the app but I noticed that not all my exercises are actually being added up correctly. For example I did 18 sessions this week but the app is saying I only did 14. Reset my watch and uninstalled/reinstalled the app to see if that would fix it but no luck. Would appreciate if you guys could fix that so I could have an accurate count of calories burned/time worked out in a week without busting out the caculator. Other than that I love the app just wish that one aspect would be looked into,3
Samsung Health,"Used to work brilliantly not won't even log in, the app was just closing instantly soon as I opened it. Uninstalled and downloaded again from play store now it won't log in. Soon as I pass the verification via text I get a blank white screen with a spinning graphic then it won't go any further. I used to love this app as it worked so well via my Samsung galaxy watch. Very disappointed. Tried to gain access and reinstall about 4 times with no luck",1
Samsung Health,"Good, but needs a sense of community to keep people engaged in the app (see fitbit's app - it is a whole social network). I wish I could create a blog on the app or communicate with others on it. Needs more. PS. Also do not remove useful features (weigh management - I don't even use that, but I acknowledge how important that is for some) Edit 10/9, just read you're removing more features including articles. This just makes the application less appealing. Please add useful features at least.",3
Samsung Health,After this last update it is not working at all. Steps are not being tracked and information is not being synched Why did you have to mess with something that was working great and not broke! Totally worthless. Fix it back to the way it was or at least give option for us to undo this last update. Went from 5 stars to 0,1
Samsung Health,The App is not too bad but I have the Samsung watch Active 2 and the location sensor in the watch is absolutely horrible. I use other apps when I run to get a accurate mileage count. The active 2 has me cutting thru peoples yards because it just looses the GPS signal no matter where I use it. Like I said I use other apps with my phone to get an accurate mileage. Other than that I like the app.,3
Samsung Health,"I really like this App, I have used it to help me loose 100lbs so far. I would give it 5 stars, but the heart rate monitor doesn't work well. I don't know if it's my Samsung s8+ or the app, but it takes 2 to 5+ minute for it to register and by that time, my heart rate as fallen so much. I can never get a maximum heart rate or even an accurate rate",2
Samsung Health,"2 stars due to not being able to view weekly daily reports. You only can see weekly summaries which only give you you weekly average. My Fitbit Apps allowed the user to view the exact number of steps each day for any particular week. If I am doing a step challenge how am I supposed to track my daily steps for the week, write them down and keep a personal log? Really wish they will upgrade the app to provide details of your history not just a average",2
Samsung Health,"Will you please stop changing this app!! It's been perfectly ok for at least the 3 or 4 years that I've been using it. Now, over the last few months it has been ""updated"" twice & each time it's got worse!!! I used to check my pulse every day but that got removed last time - why??? And now you have messed with the step display. Now its stupidly small and hard to read. At least 95% of all the comments are complaints about the removal of one function or another. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DONT FIX IT",2
Samsung Health,"Been using this app for at least 3 years to count my steps. But lately it's been missing so many of my steps. I didn't have this problem for the last 3 years but now it's missing a lot of my steps which may be minor to some but I count my steps as part of a challenge at work and have to use other methods of step counting because this app now misses so many steps. Stop with the updates, it's perfectly fine smh! I also use this app to calorie for intake, blood pressure and weight. It's a good app.",3
Samsung Health,"Not only does it not sync with fitbit the Samsung community has been disabled too, I bought an app to over ride and sync with Samsung health / fitbit and then the step count got disabled too My 3* review has gone down to 1* as the updates do not seem to be for the better anymore also challenges etc limited compared to other companies ",1
Samsung Health,"I love seeing my steps, but they just reduced the size of the numbers so they can add their name ""samsung"" and a giant red heart to the widget. If I can't glance down to see my steps, then why have the widget at all? I removed it. Taking up 4 spaces for big #s is ok, but now I have 3 more apps I can have in its place",4
Samsung Health,"Use the weight management for so long. It helped me loose over 40 pounds. After a year or so of being off my fitness management I just started again and feel really sad not to have this great tool for me. Please consider putting back this feature, it really helps keeping track of what you are doing well or not.",1
Samsung Health,I've been a fan of this app but when I got pregnant I realised that many features were no longer able to give me useful information based on my needs. If pregnancy features could be added that would be amazing. Otherwise I'm going to search for an app that will track along with my pregnancies and can sync with a smart watch that will too.,3
Samsung Health,"I use this app every day to keep up with my steps and ❤ bpm. It also tells me how stressed I am and O2 levels! It's very easy to use. I especially love the monthly challenges with other users, worldwide. It let's me know what level I'm on as far as my average steps for my age group. Love it!",5
Samsung Health,"I like how the info from my watch gets transferred (usually, but not always, sadly), but there's no good way to access the data from this app on a PC. It's much easier to actually USE the info this app captures on a larger screen than my phone. That logic SHOULD be obvious to the designers of this app.",
Samsung Health,"I downloaded the Samsung Health app as I purchased the Galaxy Watch3 to complement my S20 Ultra. I am disappointed with the app as it no longer offers weight management effectively. You can not set up goals with start and end dates and monitor correct calorie intake. Weight management is an essential feature and encourages better fitness goals. Removing this makes no logical sense. At first, I thought it was an issue with my configuration. However, after a search online, there is a press release from Samsung that states they are removing this feature and appears it will not be coming back anytime soon. I then came across the reviews here with scores of complaints about the removal of this feature. I have now decided to return my Galaxy Watch3 to John Lewis (it's brand new) there is no point in keeping this watch if it won't track essential fitness features. This is my first Samsung Watch. I have been using Fitbit products for the last eight years and decided I wanted a change after I got bored with the Fitbit Ionic design; I wanted something similar to what Samsung is offering. I did not know that Samsung has discontinued it's weight management features. Thankfully, I still have my older Ionic and will now go back to using it and wait for the new Fitbit Ionic to be released or maybe wait and see if Samsung will listen to its customers and bring back this vital feature. Annoying really and a waste of 'time",1
Samsung Health,Reinstalled and now works fine but running 🏃 is not working perfectly. After running the run times are shown but after some time the running is converted to walk with less step count. Right now I am walking 🚶 double walk to keep in my challenge. Please fix the app soon. I am using Google fit app as a backup so I know exactly how long I walk 🚶 or run 🏃 daily. Thank you.,3
Samsung Health,"At least give us the possibility to roll back to the previous version before the unfortunate update! All my progress is lost and the app lost many useful and fun features. And please don't tell me to call the number to solve the problems, that is NOT a solution!",1
Samsung Health,"Last update very disappointing, weight management widget removed, also now have to set my own calorie target where previous version you had to choose how much weight you want to lose weekky and the app calculated what the calorie deficit should be, all these options are gone. Its a shame they have done that.",3
Samsung Health,"Does not have away to manually check BP,STRESS OR HEART RATE THIS is a glitch with the note 20 because the note 9 was fine,I have lost my data.Do you think you could get one of those cameras to read again or fix it in an update, I own a fit it and I do not want a samsung watch the phone use to be enough.",3
Samsung Health,This USED to be a really good app. Now though it's starting to suck balls 😔. There taking away features that they had and also now my step counter doesn't sync with my fitness app I use. I contacted Samsung Health and basically they told me to do all the things I already did and nothing more. I'm getting disappointed with it now 👹🖓🖕🔥💩.,3
Samsung Health,"Step tracking not working for historical view, can you see if have hit target for past days of go into achievements as it won't show in tracking data anymore. But seems to calculate for challenges. And have done all reboots, cache wipes etc seems to have happened since update 27th September. (FYI- I am based in NZ so I can't call the number you provide)",1
Samsung Health,The app functions as it should and I enjoy the features. What I don't enjoy is that I purchased my Gear FIT2 because it was supposed to have an ECG feature coming at some point. Apparently that feature is now available BUT ONLY IF YOU ALSO PURCHASED A PHONE FROM SAMSUNG. Such a shady business practice. I was already a customer. I won't be in the future.,5
Samsung Health,"There is a problem with steps counter, sometimes it's stop tracking my steps for a while( 3 hours or more) i keep refreshed the app and open it many times but nothing changes.It's just stops counting, And oxygen saturation taking so long to measure.. when I was infected with COVID-19 i kept measure",1
Samsung Health,I loved this app and lost quite a bit of weight. This last update though took the best function off. The weight management function was the best part. I need this function back. If it comes back I will be able to give a minimum of 4 stars but without this function it really doesn't work for me,1
Samsung Health,"This app can't sync anymore with my fitness pal which I've used for a long time to lose weight (successfully). Samsung is going towards a very disappointing path, disabling a lot of features which have been really good so far (e.i. mirrorlink). In addition this is the only app for weight and nutrition management not allowing you to scan foods bar codes. Honestly I won't be buying anymore samsung phones or other products.",2
Samsung Health,"I use this app for weight, food and nutrient logging, and I've been satisfied with it up until a couple weeks ago. Now, the nutrition targets seem off. For example, my targets used to say about 45 protein and 26 fiber, but now it says 56 protein and 38 fiber. Are those targets for males? If so, my app still says female in the settings, so something isn't right with the app under the hood. 🤔 Update 9/30/2020: Clearing cache didn't help. Rebooting the phone corrects it for awhile",3
Samsung Health,05 Oct 20 Samsung health captured the steps walked for the day. On 06 Oct 20 when checking the total for the previous day (05 Oct 20) it read 'No recorded step data'. Why? It had been recording the steps for years? Reply received 'clear cache'; thank you so much. Missing data was restored the next 24 hour period.,5
Samsung Health,"why is it that this samsung app is so rubbish at maths???? 8270 steps on 1st of October + 10824 so far today (2nd October) definitely does not make 15994 but this app seems to think it does. and yes, i know it has to update, and it has just done that. so that's over 3000 steps that I've lost already this month due someone's inability to fix a bug that I first reported 2 years ago! If someone from samsung health would like to contact me I have screen shots to prove there is an issue!",1
Samsung Health,No longer records live heart rate data during exorcise. What's the point in an expensive wearable with an expensive phone when the companies own health app won't record the most vital data. As things stand right now I feel cheated spending money on these devices. (Edit) the number in samsungs resopnce is useless as I'm in the UK. I have spent two day in chat and on the phone trying to resolve the issue and all that's happened is I've lost all my ride data that was stored in the app.,1
Samsung Health,"Counts fake steps without any accessories connected on A5 2017 and A41 2020. My phone is lying on the table most of time since I work at the computer, but the app counts some fake steps. Yesteray I walked one kilometer at max, but Samsung Health decided that I made 11000 steps, what!? The built-in meal database is not verified and provides wrong information about food. You can still create your own meal database, but... you cannot search there, so you have to scroll your menu LF what you need.",1
Samsung Health,"Ever since the last update, the app's ability to record sleep has been completely broken. Update: I appreciate the phone number but I'm well aware of how to troubleshoot an application and don't really need someone to walk me through it. I've already tried to troubleshoot the application and it has not fixed the issue",2
Samsung Health,"This app doesn't work. I ran 5km with my phone on my arm with the holder and the app said I walked 0.5km and 600 steps, so the distance count doesn't work and the steps count doesnt too because that's like 9m per step if the steps are accurate. great to know I broke the world record! 😊 Anyway please fix this, I had crevice and the other apps saw my location so you have a problem",1
Samsung Health,"Good general app with, sadly, a lot of ANNOYING failures. Biggest gripe: Tracks altitude, but doesn't summarise total climb!!! WHAT IS THE POINT?! Samsung do ANY of your developers run/cycle/walk hills or mountains??? Utter fail, folks. -sit up and dumbell rep counts don't work with Galaxy watch Active 2. Denying one of the big points of buying the watch. Weight has to be manually input, despite my scales app being a Google one.",3
Samsung Health,"Last update of the app didn't exactly improve the experience. The history view is now harder to screen, since it shows now per week. I've been having also issues with my Samsung watch, hardly detects when I'm cycling. Most of the times I need to add the information manually in the app. Overall experience is not great.",3
Samsung Health,Thanks for messing up this app again. The sleep data from my Gear S smart watch was fine after you finally fixed it several months ago. Now you've done yet another update and messed it up again. Oh and no I don't want a pointless international phone number to call. Or idle promises. I'd just like to see it fixed or rolled back to the previous version. Stop messing things up and leave it alone...,1
Samsung Health,Had this app on my old Samsung phone and it was great. Now got an a20e and this app is now hopeless. Most irritating is that location info is switched off so does not track my route or record distance on walking & hiking modes (the only two I use). I have looked in settings which says location & physical activity is allowed & switched on so why won't it record distance & route. Total waste of time if I can't see these.,1
Samsung Health,"I love this app I recommend it to friends, it has some wonderful features. to be able to check your heart rate and oxygen levels on a phone app is fantastic. I have verified it at the doctor's office against their equipment and it's completely accurate. I am so sad I traded my Samsung S9 for the s20 and the oxygen and heart rate equipment is gone, I depend on this program and it's gone. During the virus they removed this app? What is Samsung thinking",1
Samsung Health,"Hi there, Thanks for responding with a helpful answer, I really do appreciate that. I'm unable to find any ""Measure Multiple"" option in the app. When I check ""Notices"", they're displayed in French... I got my Note8 in Australia through my carrier (Optus), it's never been overseas and the only languages I have setup are English (AU & US). I can't change the language the notices are displayed in either. I really don't know what to do next, could you please give me some insight here? Thank you!",1
Samsung Health,"The app is getting better with each update. Please bring back the graph for each exercise. It used to show a graph of how many chin ups for example, that you have done during the week. Now it just shows a workout overview, no graph. Also in the workout graph for heart rate, can you make the line from the highlight balloon easier to see? It nearly impossible to see once you start scrolling i",5
Samsung Health,"Was really useful, until they removed the visualisation of calories in vs calories burned. This app was actually one of the reasons I stuck with Samsung through Notes 8, 9 and 10. The changes made here helped me decide NOT to get a Note 20, and to look to another brand when my 10 needs to be replaced. Nice work, Samsung!",1
Samsung Health,Can benefit from a feature that allows one to add nutrition values for new foods using a bar code scanner (available in some apps like MyFitnessPal). And a feature that allows to save recipes that one makes from scratch but eats frequently. Update: Really upsetting that weight and calorie management features were removed and the new features that allow to make adding calories easier was not added. I understand some users might not need it but give users the option to choose.,1
Samsung Health,"Overall happy, but would be happier with a couple options added. It would be great if the options ""pregnant"" and ""breastfeeding"" could be added under the profile options as those life events affect weight, water intake, and sleep. I have a newborn and thus I don't get to sleep through the night. The app keeps telling me it's not healthy to wake up in the middle of the night. True, but unavoidable with a new baby",2
Samsung Health,I like that this app will share information with my other health app. I wish I could record cholesterol the way I can with my BP and HBAC1C results (even though it's not metric). I like the oxygen and heart rate features. It will be very handy when I begin to encorpora more exercise too.,4
Samsung Health,"It is one of the best applications in sports and health, but unfortunately with the new update, the possibility of measuring blood oxygen has been eliminated, compared to special measuring devices was the same. Please restore this feature.",3
Samsung Health,"t's a useful app but when I choose hiking it goes far beyond what I have really passed. Even when I am taking rest and not moving, it counts the distance. That's why I can not use the app for hiking. But for walking and running it quit works well",3
Samsung Health,"The app is pretty good, but when I use my band to track exercises and the app isn't in open in the screen, the localization doesn't work at all. I think it will be good to the app to have an ""Aways use location"" instead of ""Only while using the app",4
Samsung Health,"I use this all the time and I've watched my calories, active minutes, steps and burned calories to lose 30 lbs over summer with minimum effort. I do miss the weight management option",4
Samsung Health,"I love using the app to track all of my health needs, but I'm having issues with logging my food. I'm on keto, and a lot of my foods contain sugar alcohols which the app doesn't recognize, so it looks like my carb cou t is much higher. Can there be a way to record the sugar alcohols?",3
Samsung Health,"Still my fave health app after trying all the others. Just so easy to use and handy having workouts, nutrition, steps, fitness and sleep all in one. One thing I would LOVE to add to the app, is the ability to change your macro goals, not just total calories.... then it would be PERFECT!",5
Samsung Health,"Used and loved samsung health for years. Ad of mid October the app no longer allows me to monitor stress, oxygen or heart rate. Also stopped counting steps. I've deleted and reinstalled, looked for ways to correct. Appears that unless you upgrade to premium the app is worthless. Disappointing",1
Samsung Health,"I had been using the app for a couple of years and it was fine. Lately, when I try to open it, I get an alert that I can't open the app due to a lack of sufficient memory. I can open all my other apps. With this one I get the alert even after freeing what memory I can.",1
Samsung Health,"Several updates later and still no improvement. REMOVED WEIGHT MANAGEMENT from the dashboard! The most useful features of the app. The new UI looks like it was designed by an 8 year old. Different tones of the same colour for the nutrient intake that will look cool! While we're at it use as much green as possible. Who cares about using colour intentionally. This app is one of the reasons I stay with Samsung, that reason is rapidly diminishing.",1
Samsung Health,"Great app to keep track of your health and fitness. Keeps records, which are compiled in an easy to understand manner. Has several subdivisions for different aspects of your health. Heart rate and stress monitoring systems are great. Does not irritate with unnecessary notifications.",5
Samsung Health,"Requires network. Often I have no network access, the new update means the app won't open without network, I can't view my history, can't take my heart rate. Too bad, I liked it, but without network, it's not usable. It's a Samsung app, I hope it can be un-installed",2
Samsung Health,It is rather frustrating to purchase a watch/device for its known features only to find out you have to own the same company's other expensive devices just to use those features. To use the ECG feature their website says you must own a Samsung phone as well! I just spent a pile of money this year on,2
Samsung Health,"The app was great until this last update. It no longer syncs steps to myfitnesspal. It is reading from it fine. I confirmed the sync settings didn't change. Help correct this please! Update from Myfitnesspal, they are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it. Not direct issue with this app.",5
Samsung Health,"The app is pretty good overall. It syncs with other apps well, and the goal setting is nice daily/weekly incentive/reminder to remain active. The negative is the GPS doesn't register certain activity well. Rollerblading or bike riding it doesn't register the distance and only keeps track of time",3
Samsung Health,The app worked great on my S9+ until a software update in the summer. Now it won't maintain communication with my Accu-Chek Guide glucometer. They are paired but data just won't receive to this app. It will work for a few hours after unpairing and repairing then it's back to failing. Emails to suppo...,1
Samsung Health,"Everything was great and I was showing off the best feature it could offer: the weight management that shows calorie intake and calories burned and gives advice like eat a meal or do exercise if needed. Its gone and I was going to look and see what I needed to do today and I can't. I lost 17 out of ...
",1
Samsung Health,"I've been using this app for a long time, I really like it. Last week it didn't keep track of my sleep, the calories intake or anything else I had wanted. So I'm not sure what happened. I really like the fact it keeps track of my daily steps and how many miles I walk",5
Samsung Health,"I am using it for a while now... I decided to lose my weight few yeare ago. Due to my over weight I can't wear my favorite outfits, whenever I start my workout I will lose the dedication and confidence within few days but after using this application I counted my water intake, food intake and the ",5
Samsung Health,This was the best app when I started using it years ago. As an asthmatic I loved the pulse-ox capability. Saw that capability removed not too long ago. Imagine my surprise when Apple is now advertising that capability in their watch. You need to bring that capability back. Might be a thought to add ,4
Samsung Health,I really do not like the new widget update. You have made the writing smaller for step count but also kept the widget so big that theres a huge gap between the step count and heart monitor. Please either make the step count number big again or allow us to customise the widget by being able to make ,1
Samsung Health,"App is OK. ""women's health"" is a joke. No ""spotting"" option available for logging flow or symptoms, really? Or ""extra heavy""? Samsung, any female developers and testers on this team? This is one area where the fitbit app is way better. Plus, one should be able to log info simply by long pressing the day on the calendar.",3
Samsung Health,"I've used this app for years now and it has never accurately counted floors. I love the heart rate and oxygen checks. I also love the sleep monitor. I do however, wish that Rebounding would be added to the exercise list. Hopefully you can make that happen! Overall, I like it! Don't forget to add Rebounding! Thank!",4
Samsung Health,"Generally good app, but doesn't include options, such as gardening, push mowing, vacuuming etc which are more appropriate for actions undertaken by users that are unlikely to go to a gym or of an age not to play football, tennis etc. For example, I spend 4 hours each week pushing a heavy lawn mower, but there is no consideration given to such activities. Similarly, sawing firewood is very energy dependent; so, include these activities and the app will be twice as useful as it is at present.",4
Samsung Health,"The recent update removed data permissions for food, coffee and weight logs. I use the application daily especially for vitality points for my insurance. Since they have been removed I can no longer receive points. Please fix......... UPDATE 09/27/2020!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After recent update to fix the bugs it didn't work. I powered my phone to see if that would help and it didn't. **UPDATE 9/28/2020 MY VERSION is 6.12.0.029",1
Samsung Health,"Would give it a no star if I could, since the latest update I've had nothing but trouble getting on the app. It keeps crashing, screen goes black, doesn't register anything if I can get on the page. If I'm lucky I can get access for about 10 minutes a day all for nothing. Total waste of time using it. Sort it out please because it's useless at the moment.",1
Samsung Health,"Would be nice to have counting smoked cigs, for smokers which want to track and lower cigs per day. Probably possible success only with ecigs. Notification when time after last smoke is enough for daily quota. Manual tracking will not work, you know that already, didnt you?",5
Samsung Health,"Things work well most of the time it does lose GPS constantly, which I use constantly for other apps that don't have an issue with it . The other thing is right now I'm at about 8,000 steps but according to my run I am only at about 3 and 1/2 MI",4
Samsung Health,"I used to be able to measure my heart rate via the camera. Now it doesn't do that? What happened Samsung? This used to measure my heart rate and stress level and oxygen, now I have to manually enter everything? I'll just write it down at home, thanks",1
Samsung Health,Bought the Samsung watch for weight management and now found out they have removed this key feature. What more odd is that on the watch it tells me to activate this function on the app but it is no longer there. What the hell would this be removed for. So many other fitness trackers do this and you can count calories to reach goals. Most stupid decision ever and will be taking the watch back and getting a fitbit or Garmin.,1
Samsung Health,"I would give it 5 stars cause I love the app, but this is the 2nd time I've had this issue with the app where I can't even open it and it tells me my access is denied. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it and I still have the same issue. By the time I call customer service it's a whole long drawn-out process to try to fix it",4
Samsung Health,"I used to use this faithfully through Samsung phones..the last couple years, its been worthless..doesn't have an accurate step count, very few options on my note10+ to choose from and now the spo2 requires another device..i bought ur phone i don't need to buy ur watch to do what the phone used to do.. other devices actually have it built in their program..this program is obsolete..I'm ashamed of samsung, they're getting lazy and cheap..prices go up but product value goes down..smart phone, ha!",2
Samsung Health,"I find this app pretty good to use, but there are a few elements that can be improve. It'd be great if you could start an activity on your phone and watch your progress in real time on your s gear watch, or if you could customise the challenges between friends and not just the generic step challenge. Additionally, I feel there is a lack of men's health elements on the app for example links to mental health apps or testicular/prostate cancer awareness, you know things like that.",4
Samsung Health,"Recently Samsung Health was updated & a few days later (9/29) My Fitness Pal was updated. At that point there was a disconnect of data migration between the 2 Apps. I have uninstalled both, rebooted android device then reinstalled apps to no avail. My Fitness Pal is aware and asked that I also reach out to Samsung Health. Regards, Dennis Weinman

Samsung Health,"Fixed problems by uninstalling and then reinstalling. Now works OK again. - - - - - - - - - Used to work. Now it doesn't record steps properly and results from the previous days go missing. I have paused and restarted the app, rebooted the phone etc as advised. Makes a difference and then it fails again. There's a bug that needs fixing which has been introduced in the latest version. Please fix and release an upgrade!",4
Samsung Health,"I really like the programmes on this app, but since the app updated today after I enabled it following a year or so of having it disabled, the Discover tab says ""No items"". Also, I would really appreciate having the option to switch off calorie tracking on ""Active time"" - this is not something that I personally want to see, and it does not put me in a healthy mindset. I also wish it was possible to turn off the step tracker - I just want to use the programmes and log my activities manually.",4
Samsung Health,"Where is ECG? So far I've been very happy with this app and my Galaxy Active2 (Tizen Ver. 5.5.0.1). But where, please, is the ECG possibility? Been waiting for it since last fall and now it's available - at least that's what one reads all over the internet. Any help and info would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance",4
Samsung Health,"I was using this for motivation on my phone, you know to keep me consistent on my workouts, and it works. Helps me thrive to get my steps in, I got myself a fit bit to help out and it synchronizes real good to this app. I even got my husband into it, he even asked me to order him a fit bit so he can keep track of his activity and heart rate and all that using this app. Since using I lost 30 lbs!! Yup, it does help to keep track of what workouts you do and when you do them, even the heart rate.",5
Samsung Health,"Removing the weight management section has rendered this app almost useless now. I would make minor tweaks and adjustments to my diet based on my goals, losing fat/gaining muscle/more or less active one week to the next etc. This is now a headache to do. I'll move to another app after years of using this If using another brand of android phone it is awkward logging in. *I eventually skipped the step of logging in and removed my Samsung account from the list of sync options. Re-added & it worked",3
Samsung Health,I love this app. I dont use it's full potential. Mostly use the sleep tracking and weight. The O² reading is questionable and stress reading. Sometimes it takes several times to even try to get a reading. I use to track food and they were good when I did use them. They've eliminated alot of work out features. That was disappointing,5
Samsung Health,It was a very useful watch for weight management until they removed the calories burnt feature. Now I use it primarily as just a watch and am unlikely to purchase a new one when the time comes. I've also noticed that the auto Goodnight mode seems to have disappeared and I need to activate it manually every night.,2
Samsung Health,I had this on my last phone and it worked great. It won't even open on my new phone. Have tried uninstalling and installing it again but nothing. It says: Can't set up the app. This service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later. (0x07...). What am I missing? I've had this phone for months!,1
Samsung Health,"*UPDATED* NOW (FROM 29TH Sept) MY STEPS HAVE STOPPED SYNCING TO MY FITNESS PAL...?? Not sure about this latest app. I dont like the fact that the weight status showing if you are under, in, or above target calorie range for the day has disappeared (think it was called weight management?). I have successfully managed to reach and stay at my target weight since Feb 2019 using these feature to manage my calorie intake. Why has this feature been removed?",3
Samsung Health,"Nice app for 12 year olds or elderly people simply to count steps, but not the serious workout monitoring device. Constantly having workouts missing heart rate data , and there is no way to edit a workout if it continues to count 20 minutes after I've stopped running. Ameaturs or children only should use this device or app",1
Samsung Health,"Update: Samsung has not return any of the features that made it rise above the other apps. What kind of update is it if it makes it worse? Now, it offers additional programs which you have to pay for. It's just sad! When are you going to place weight management back into the app? I can use any app to track food but weight management set this app apart from the rest. Please return the weight management tool back to us.",2
Samsung Health,This app was great until you updated it. Why do developers do that all the time? You took a GREAT app and ruined it. The numbers are also WAY too small on the widget now. How can I go back to the good version? And please stop updating something that doesn't need fixed! I've been using this app since,1
Samsung Health,Issues since last updates. Not sure if it's the galaxy wear update or Samsung health. Love watch but lately having issues with workouts where it keeps pausing. Like riding bike and watch keeps pausing workout. Very annoying. Otherwise love the combination of watch and app. Please fix this issue!,3
Samsung Health,"I can only agree with the above comments. What have you done to this app? It was great before, we had total control over it. Now you've taken that away and its beyond disappointing. Anyone recommend another decent app that works with gear3",5
Samsung Health,Can't understand how can Samsung justify showing ads in the application required to fully utilise paid for hardware. I was on the market for a new watch and that was the final straw which pushed me away from having another Samsung Wearable. What's next? Ads on the watchface every few minutes?,2
Samsung Health,"I've been using a galaxy watch active until it broke recently, and I have been v happy with it. So I went and purchased a new active 2 and little did I know they decided to remove the calorie counter on the Samsung Health app. Like. It's baffling to me. HOW. DO. YOU. NOT. KNOW. THAT A HUGE PORTION OF YOUR USERS BUY THE WATCH JUST FOR THAT?! Now I regret having purchased a new galaxy watch active 2. Should've gone with my gut and went for Fitbit instead.",1
Samsung Health,"Works great, and it ain't Google. Just waiting for Microsoft to come out with their version, or Garmin if I switch watches. Some of the odds and ends features have been dropped, which is discouraging, but it makes sense if not many people were using them. I surely wasn't. Good app if your in the Samsung ecosystem.",5
Samsung Health,.I'm using Galaxy watch active 2. The application is working quite good but the heart rate monitor cannot be used to monitor the heart rate continuously and get the data every minute in a period of time. It is very important for accessing the data of someone's heart rate in every minute to be used as..,2
Samsung Health,This app does okay. It has some problems that if they fixed it would get it a higher rating. some of the settings get recorded automatically and you're not able to edit them manually. For example it records what it thinks is your sleep patterns but it won't let you edit them manually.,5
Samsung Health,"My favourite function of this app was the weight management and this latest update has taken that away. From all the other reviews since the update, I can see I am not alone in the frustration. Just bring back that function please. Edit: So it's now mid October and I take it the weight management won't be coming back, which now makes this app pointless",1
Samsung Health,Was super easy to set up on phone and for my Galaxy Active watch but I am trying to connect with my work's Wellness app so steps sync for a challenge and the app doesn't show up under Data and Permissions. Already connected to MyFitnessPal but does that sync real time or only at certain times during.,4
Samsung Health,"A little inconsistent. As good as any other app for tracking steps and most workouts. Takes a long time to load workouts since the last update. And they seem to keep taking away the good features at each update, and adding a few things here and there but nothing really useful.",3
Samsung Health,"I just upgraded to a new phone (not the latest model but newer than what I had!) and I can't even get the Samsung Health widget to function. I loved using it and want it, but it never gets me past the permissions screen no matter how many times I click to accept the terms. What am I doing wrong?",1
Samsung Health,"Totally sucks now! Was better. Cannot even check my pulse with the phone anymore,, no more stress reader, no more pulse ox. Not really of much use unless you want a place to log bp or below the step counter will have me at a hundred steps for turning off the wake up alarm. They want me to call them, for what? Old review: There used to be a separate pulse oximeter but that seems to have disappeared. Too bad, sometimes the stress reader won't pick mine up now there is no way to do it separately.",1
Samsung Health,"As Nikola said in her post , I add to it ....give an option to choose between this week sessions and as before each individual day session . I go for a long walk over 30 minutes for example. and it comes up ""active time: and shows nothing for "" all exercises"" as it did before with map of my course etc. but that's what updates do. the dude sitting in the chair who does not even know how the program works comes up with something brilliant that doesn't apply to anyone",3
Samsung Health,"Waited over a month for a new update hoping you would bring back the ""Weight Management"" feature but NOPE, still not there!! Step counter is WAY off and can no longer auto sync workouts. Which is pointless anyways seems how calories burned during workouts and steps reflected on the Weight Management feature. I used that to keep track of pushing myself harder and keeping motivated. PLEASE BRING BACK WEIGHT MANAGEMENT FEATURE AND FIX THE STEP COUNTER!!!",1
Samsung Health,I have used Samsung health and my fitness pal together for years. All of sudden no more steps are being tracked between apps. Contacted my fitness pal since the samsung health app was tracking my steps. My fitness pal said they have contacted samsung health and asked me to contact Samsung health with my issue.

In reply to the response I didn't ask for SpO2 but for a l/min peak flow tracker so I don't need an other app. Your reply makes me question if they have the right people programming this app.,3
Samsung Health,Up until today when Galaxy Wearable did an update (may be unrelated) this app worked fine. Now it shows heart rate data in to the trends so it has recorded heart rate but does not display it on the recorded exercise which makes recording exercise a little redundant. Edit: Not making expensive international call to discuss as sugested. App did work by updating watch s/ware but now not working again. Useless and disappointing. Contact email doesn't accept emails outgoing only! 1 star only now.,1
Samsung Health,Not so great at coaching and there r some critical misses. I cannot add a min/km pace for the distance I want to run. It's either speed and / or distance which is difficult to set for the distance I want to run. For instance you cannot set a 7 minutes per kilometer pace for 5 km...😰😰😰😰,2
Samsung Health,"I use this app with my gear sport watch for running. Concerned about the reporting of heart rate zone. It, 98% of the time is in maximum zone. Never improves, I haven't just started running. Not sure if it is the app or watch 🤔",4
Samsung Health,"There are some useful tools, like blood oxygen level and pulse. Unfortunately, the exercise monitor is unreliable. Frequently it doesn't record exercise at all or stops half way through. No way to get an overall picture. Hopeful it will be fixed soo",2
Samsung Health,It was a pretty useful app until the latest update. I can barely see the number of my steps because the pont became so small. I've tried to find the way to make it large and noticible easily but only to fail because it was just the problem related to the basic setting of this app,2
Samsung Health,"How can I stop the ad on my Samsung Health? I frequently use the app to monitor my health stats and your ad is starting to be annoying. I'm a middle age man and all the ads showing are for women and how to monitor menstrual cycle (with all due respect). The f#@k, if you really want to push ads, atle",2
Samsung Health,"Today I returned to using Samsung Health with my new Active Watch, I was shocked to still not see a bar code reader in the food part of the app. Sadly the app lets the watch down more so in such a time where people have such busy lifes. Old Review Below I use my Gear phone and watch every day, however it would be good to see some form of a disability section, im under my target but this is due to having spinal problems and arthritis in hips and arm.",3
Samsung Health,"Keeps spinning the wheel after entering account details to login. Tried 5 times, doesn't get past this. Shockingly amateur!! . . Edit to respond to developer: No, that does NOT help. This issue has been around for months, still persists. The only way is to skip the initial login screen, get into the app and then login from within settings.",1
Samsung Health,"It had been working as it should lately, until about a week ago. As of October 1st, it's suddenly showing all my sleep to be restless once again. I don't know why that keeps happening, but maybe that should be an area you double check before releasing an update.",3
Samsung Health,The only thing I would change would be to ADD a upc scanning option to count calories. UPDATE I would also like for carbs to be counted correctly. For example to get NET CARBS you minus the dietary fiber and some sugars. For people on specific diets ( who isn't right?? ) This would be very helpful,3
Samsung Health,"great idea, but most things just don't work quite right. cool that there is a pulse-oxy sensor, but it is very inaccurate. nice that it tracks steps, except that it misses more steps than it counts, etc.",2
Samsung Health,The app is very useful. The only problem I have is that it does not show the elevation gain for biking. It only shows the starting and finishing elevation. I wish it would show the total elevation gain during the whole trip.,3
Samsung Health,It's a great app but I didn't give it 5 stars because it's only compatible with Samsung watches. Obviously they are trying to force you to buy their products. Otherwise I like the together feature and that you can include your friends and family. It's a good motivation.,4
Samsung Health,"The app is no doubt one of the best fitness tracking app. I have a suggestion, kindly add steps audio guide also apart from kms, mins and hours. I think for every 1000 steps the app can announce this. It would be helpful for all who target steps",4
Samsung Health,"I use the walking pedometer everyday. Today, my current phone was in the shop and I used my old phone (Galaxy S7) to measure my walk. Although it is no longer on a mobile network, it still connects to my wi-fi at home. Will those miles compile to my total walking history? And how can I see that history on my PC?",4
Samsung Health,Rated 2 star for this particular concern. Previous version had a quick reference gauge for calories intake versus calories burned... Can't understand why this feature would even be considered to be removed... Suggestion Bring it back as a dashboard option,2
Samsung Health,Since the last update steps aren't being measured correctly. Another pedometer app I have read the same as hers yet my Samsung Health one was wildly out. And AGAIN just as it starts to count steps properly its 'updated' and stops. I've followed Samsung's advice on resetting it etc and it's made no difference,1
Samsung Health,"I own a Samsung galaxy phone and 2 samsung watches. I use the active 2 to track my cycling. When i do, the voice out says i have completed 1 mile every single time even after i have done 6 miles. Why? On the other hand, the older watch will say i have completed 6 miles. Why the inconsistencies? Does the software need an update to reflect accumulated mileage?",4
Samsung Health,"The app was pretty well till a short time ago. Today the app registers the running period and the walking period during the workout, but if you want to check it later, it'll be all accumulated under the active time. I find that really frustrating.
",3
Samsung Health,"Please bring back trends in exercise. This was extremely useful in tracking by weeks or months with little to no effort. Recent update took away this option under exercises panel but still available under other selection (sleep, water, active time, etc.",5
Samsung Health,"Following most recent update the sensor on my Note 9 will no longer register in Health. The sensor works fine in all other respects, e.g. it will read my fingerprint to unlock the phone, but does nothing now in your app! Not very useful if I can't measure anything. Great freaking update Samsung!!!",1
Samsung Health,"1 star at the moment as it won't open on my new phone, wouldn't sync on my old phone before I changed and then deleted all my data on my watch when I tried to sync my watch to my new phone. Why doesn't it auto sync? And how can I get it to open on my new phone? I know it's not the password as that",1
Samsung Health,"Really nice app. Love love love. Fitness and food and sleep and water tracking and period tracking for mah ladies.... I do however wish there was a way to change the cal unit to kilojoule but its not such a problem, I've gotten used to it",5
Samsung Health,Older versions are better than this version. This version getting automatically paused and start. And step counting distance counting is going wrong. Please overcome this problem because this own Samsung app not third party app as I didn't expect from you,2
Samsung Health,"My only complaint is the monthly challenges. There is absolutley no way you have people walking/running over 215,000 steps per day. There should be a way to weed out the cheaters.its very demotivating!",4
Samsung Health,"As many other users, I can't sync this app wirh MyFitnessPal anymore! It used to track my steps and update on both platforms. Tried everything from uninstalling, website and support forums. Want the old version back. Don't fix if it ain't broke!",1
Samsung Health,"Hello , For Weight is there a way to look at your weight history since you started recording in one view like under armor my fitness pal application does. It looks pretty good and easy to see the full history of your weight. Thank you",4
Samsung Health,September 30 2020 the app update but did not bring back the weight management app or the caffeine app. UPDATE October 14 2020 I stayed with the app to see if it would bring back the weight management app but nothing I guess Samsung Health dont care about what we think. So I guess it time for me to switch to the iPhone YET ANOTHER UPDATE October 25 2020 and still no weight management app seriously come on Samsung put it back on that iPhone 12 shore dose look nice.,1
Samsung Health,The app causes lag while syncing with android phones orher than samsung. My galaxy watch 3 data is not synced regularly with my one plus 7 Keeps showing no device connected even when the device is connected. I have also experienced phone getting heated up while trying to sync my watch with my phone,1
Samsung Health,Since upgrading phone have lost heart rate and stress test .....I now have the a51 phone with android 10 ....on my previous phone a s6 the heart tester and stress tester worked ..... .have checked forums luck ....is there a difference on the cameras....I do miss it ..as was keeping a record due the .,3
Samsung Health,"In general good expirience app gives motivation, works without big bugs, map somehow does not show after running or similar training, maybe it does not have that option anymore or I had some problem wih my gps...... After latest update works very good no problems like before!",5
Samsung Health,"What's happening to the app, never had any issues before..it appears that I'm not the only one having problems? Let know if you can't do a fix so I can delete it. Never mind it's back working correctly. Thanks!!",5
Samsung Health,"There has been an update on 21st October and still the most useful part of the app, the weight management feature, is missing Enough useless platitudes from you Samsung, listen to what people want and do something about it Who in their right minds would remove the most useful aspect ! The weight man..",1
Samsung Health,"I used to love this app. I stopped using it for a while because I fell off my diet and my routine, I went to use it and they've taken my favorite feature (weight management) off. Now I'm gonna have to find another solution that'll work better. Bring this feature back for a better review.",1
Samsung Health,I enjoy using this app. I compare steps to two other devices and it proves to be comparatively. I really enjoy the discover features as well. I track my calorie intake by entering food and I'm slowly seeing the pounds come off. My doctor says she's proud of me as am I,5
Samsung Health,"Used to love it and used it everyday for a long time. But with all the deleted things from the app and the no mens health section, I have started to use my fitness pal. It's s shame. I loved the samsung product.",1
Samsung Health,"As a runner it would be useful to have some way of logging the distance your running shoes has done. I believe there are some running apps that allow this. But I don't want extra apps. Other than that, I love this app",4
Samsung Health,When the last release removed the weight management feature I had high hopes it would be re-added in the latest update based on the negative feedback of its removal. I just downloaded the recent update and the weight management function still isn't there. That feature is the main reason I use the Samsung watch. I think I will look into other products now that this one no longer serves my needs.,1
Samsung Health,"Heeelp, wont sync to virgin pulse. Ive checked all permissions, updated to the latest version. Disconnected reconnected but nope. Im going to have to go back to google fit and that doesnt work on my samsung watch. This means i will have to excercise with my phone. Very frustrating.",3
Samsung Health,Im using Samsung Galaxy fit 2. The app and the band records my sleep well. But why doesnt it record my afternoon nap or sleep. And when i try to add manually in the app it either allows me to have only one duration you cant add the second sleep duration or nap. Is there any way?,1
Samsung Health,"they removed the weight management and caffeine intake and it was just really sad to see it go away... i havent used it as much after, only to track my cycle and steps. But i really loved the app when it was complete wish they bring it back.
",4
Samsung Health,This app worked great until the most recent update. Now it longer connects to my fitness app and when you try to reconnect the entire Samsung Health app crashes. Very frustrating & if not resolved soon I will have to look for a similar app to replace this one to continue tracking my progress,3
Samsung Health,"I am a little disappointed about this new version, before it was nice you could easily see how much calories you have burn or you have eat to much. The new style when you have to choose an activity also its like really complicated",3
Samsung Health,"Generally it's ok BUT, It would be very helpful to fully integrate it with another android tracking device's or smartwatch Also would be very helpful if I could calibrated or manually adjust length of my steps as under the number of steps distances is very different from one measured by gps when start workouts!!!",2
Samsung Health,"My daily fitness tracker. Have it linked to my Garmin ANT+ chest strap heart rate monitor. Track my morning workout (push-ups, leg raises, extensions). Love it for tracking my runs. Would like to see a ""stretching"" activity. Great food tracker! PLEASE add magnesium (very important) to nutrient list...",5
Samsung Health,For most items I can manually input the info. Pulse is only from my Gear S3.and that is the only health metric it sends to my phone Blood Oxygen is not available anywhere. Stress is just a STATIC display last updated OCT 27. My new Note 20 Ultra is not able to give my the health information I need.in this era of Covid-19 O2 is a key warning element. My Omron BP786 will not connect to this APP I have to manually input the data,2
Samsung Health,"Good app, but I have a serious issue with adding food. My system language is English, but I live in Russia and some of the product name I could use only in Russian. My workaround was to switch system language to Russian, add my common foods to favorites, and than switch system language back to English.",4
Samsung Health,"I *was* very happy with this app, especially after purchasing a Samsung Active 2 to pair with it. Now, I'm BEYOND upset that the steps no longer sync to My FitnessPal AND, as of this morning, the detailed sleep analysis is GONE. What is going over there, Samsung? Please get it together. I didn't purchase an Active 2 to serve as a glorified bracelet",1
Samsung Health,I like using this app but I swear every update makes it harder to delete sleep records. My Galaxy Fit gets my evening routine confused with sleep a lot so I go back at some point and clean up the records but the delete option is pushed into more menus every time. Only downside I've noticed from casual use so keep up the good work,4
Samsung Health,"Since I started using this app on 5G on Samsung Galaxy A11, it's completely weird! 4G shows different work out steps and kilometers and 5G shows less steps and kilometers. If I use Samsung Health indoors, it's shows this difference, however, outdoors, the readings are same. I feel, it's satellite problem that it doesn't catch the movement. For example, if I run indoors, there's difference of almost 2km compared to 4G Samsung Health app",2
Samsung Health,"I reviewed this app about 2 year ago and gave it 3 stars. I stopped using it for a while even. I resumed using it about 6 months ago and am very pleased with the updates. I am enjoying the added features as well as the improved accuracy with keeping up with my activity.",4
Samsung Health,"Still no new sign of progress to bring back the weight management section. I've reduced my rating further. Why would I use the app now? Also the activities have not been added as I requested earlier. One good thing, however, is that there's now a blood oxygen test separate from the stress monitor and the option to record if you're ill or at high altitude. An extremely useful device: a life saver under current circumstances",1
Samsung Health,"Pointless, worthless ads cluttering the screen ... The app does contain ads. The description in Google Play says it contains ads. I can supply screen shots if there is an email address or similar for this. A US phone number is not much use. Nor is a ""noreply"" email Still getting ads (Sept 30) e. g. Get a 75 voucher when you join Bulb today. Screen shot available. Received the same worthless automated response as before. Quite clearly the app does show ads. Google play agrees with me",1
Samsung Health,"2 1/2 stars UI is difficult to navigate - I always end up rummaging around to find the setting I need. The step counter counts ~15-20% more steps than I make. There's no weight management. Food items are plentiful, and yet, when I 'm adding to my meals, it's difficult to find what I need. Related to that, there's no barcode scanner for food stuffs",3
Samsung Health,"The app really does all I need.....when it's working. Since a recent update it no longer reports steps to Myfitnesspal. They blame Samsung, Samsung say its Myfitnesspal. Samsung Health tell me to update to revision that is out of date by two updates. Love the Samsung watch but your lack of support is driving me away from Samsung",3
Samsung Health,"This app worked great until the last update! I can now no longer see any sleep details, it just suggests times to record manually, but no detail like it used to have. And when I start a workout it doesn't stay on the track! Just does like 3 second and then stops!!!! And no need to tell me to call that number you're giving everyone, just please fix it or go back to how it was 🙏 This is taking away a lot of the reason why I bought my Galaxy Active 2 watch. Those that the main reasons I got it",2
Samsung Health,"Fitbit app is far more informative and less clunky. The only thing that swayed me towards Samsung is that the Active 2 watch is better looking than the Fitbits (and the Watch 3 even). But now Samsung has locked me out of the ECG feature because I don't have a Samsung phone--a limitation that was previously NEVER mentioned in their advertising!!! Lastly, the ads at the top of the Health app screen are annoying AF.",1
Samsung Health,"I had your app since I had a Samsung phone, your app was good back then. Since the removal of certain features it has gone down hill. Now you have changed the size of the widget for step counts, it it small. If you can't fix the problem to your application than I need to fine a better one. Please bring back your old version with stress, heart beat, oxyg",1
Samsung Health,"New widget: Numerals are so tiny as to be unreadable by middle-aged eyes or those needing reading glasses. Text should be switchable to black OR white to better mesh with a variety of backgrounds and should offer a variety of size options as well as the ability to resize the widget. Also the ability to disable any secondary data displayed (heart rate monitor on mine). The app itself is reasonably functional, but the widget has just become a completely useless piece of excrement. Fix it!",1
Samsung Health,"I just upgraded from a Samsung S2 Classic to an S3. The Samsung Health version on the S2 had a display of Heart Rate & Distance over time which I used all the time. I do a lot of interval training so I want to track my HR zones over time. The S3 has a new display, but I don't see the same functional",4
Samsung Health,"Recently, I started noticing that my steps are not counted as it used to be earlier - 90% of the steps are ignored and Nike+ gps is also not getting locked during runs. So I did a factory reset and still observing the issue with under counting of steps. I am using S8. Help would be appreciated!",4
Samsung Health,I totally agree with other reviews - Weight Management was the most useful feature (I lost 20kg through it in 2018) and I don't know why it was taken away. I recently bought the Samsung watch to help streamline where my data is stored and so the watch integrated with the tech I already used - I don't want to use many different apps like myfitnesspal/Gear. I need health tracking to be a small and easy part of my day and the previous version with Weight Management was perfect.,1
Samsung Health,"Barcode scanner needed! Love the app. It did lose some weight management I liked (don't know why), but everything is okay. Needs a barcode scanner for the calorie tracker. This is standard on all others. Oh, and the ads at the top are annoying.",4
Samsung Health,"I don't want target steps and heart rate on my widget. At least give the option to just have steps counted. Why not add a second option rather than removing the existing? Samsung is about full control and personalization... well it was, once. No point sending a developer number. I'm outside US",1
Samsung Health,he app is telling me to eat 1000 calories less a day when I need it to be 500 but there is no longer any setting to change how many lb you wish to lose a week its just default to 1k even when I set calorie goal to 1875 it auto reverts back to 1375 the next day 100% useless now and its screwing up my galaxy watch active because of it. Why the hell would they remove the feature to let us set our calorie deficit??????,1
Samsung Health,"For the last two months I haven't been able to sync Samsung health with the Myfitnesspal app. Up till then, I love the app and used it daily. It was very discouraging try to figure out what went wrong and now the app is useless for my health journey.",1
Samsung Health,"t was great and I absolutely loved this app before recent updates. I lost 35lbs from April-August from primarily using the weight management portion of the app and working out daily. I havent lost any weight since they removed this feature and I'm still working out daily. Losing the weight manageme...",2
Samsung Health,"I have been using this app for several years. Within the past few months an update changed the available data which was disappointing. It still tracks most things but I liked seeing more data regarding calories. But on the bright side, the tracking of sleep is automated and very accurate. Overall great app. I would give it 5 stars if it still had the old data that was removed.",3
Samsung Health,"-0 Since I wrote this review there has not been any change. I miss the old one that had everything useful to EVERYONE. I thought it was a 5 star for years. This new one is horrid! Does not have other options. I cannot set weight loss and calories set to lose; also, I cannot know if I am under, over or GOOD. Also the colours are not good for me because I cannot see the shades. I liked the drastic colour bars before. Please bring the old one again. This is no used to me.",1

Samsung Health,"My review will change after the calories dial comes back!!! In the last update it was taken out but that thing was EXTREMELY helpful with meal spacing and it's gone! Bring it back!

I hope Samsung may add the normal range and basic scientific highlights of this parameters with attractive icon modification. Then 5 stars may awarded",4
Samsung Health,"I loved the app until the last update! It has lost the weight management widget which was the one I used the most to know if I could indulge into some sweets or if I did how many calories I had to burn to be back on track.

Samsung Health,"I am truly disappointed with this app and have been actively looking for a new app and even a new watch to go with it. They took weight management section away which helped me pay attention to my calories burned and how much more I needed to do to meet my goals. Now they have taken the widget that show calories burned. Now, they have taken weekly summeries away! Good grief!",1
Samsung Health,"Update : tried what was suggested, no difference. Issue is as reported by other users, steps are counted during the day but wiped at midnight. No step data saved since 4 Oct. Also offering only the US helpline number for further support is pretty useless for your non-US users Since the last update it is not saving step data. It counts steps on the day but the next day no step data for previous day. Still shows sleep and activity records fine. Have updated, stopped, cleared cache, restarted etc.",1
Samsung Health,"The step counter has stopped saving data from 5th oct onwards. It counts steps correctly through the day but after midnight forgets data of previous day. 3 phones in my home started showing identical problem. The historical data is intact till 4th Oct.

Now looking for an app that can do what S Health used to do. Updated to latest version 25/09/20 & still no weight management section. Come on Samsung!!",1

Samsung Health,"Great app, but over the last few weeks it stops tracking my runs if I get text messages. I won't notice it unless I'm constantly looking at my pace. Then I have to restart it and I lose time and distance...",3
Samsung Health,Don't know why but this app crashes about 19 attempts out of 20 when I open. It's great when it works. Just won't open most the time. I have huwaeii phone and Samsung smart watch.,1
Samsung Health,"Was very good till last update. From the last update ,I'm unable to add foods properly. Keeps on going to unrelevant results from the searched ones. Even unable to contact the number given in the reply",2
Samsung Health,"I like the app, but they got rid of their calorie tracking programs like the calorie burned balance tracker. I no it's not super accurate but it gave me a good estimation on when I should eat and work out",1
Samsung Health,Amazing app. What would take it to 5 stars if i can go back and edit my workout on my bike. Once its saved these no going back and editing times i have to delete it and then repost kind of annoying,4
Samsung Health,"Great UI. I love the monthly step challenges and all off the smoothly integration across all Samsung devices. I have a Galaxy watch and a galaxy s9+, and its pretty easy to see all my workout information collected by my watch with this app. Keep it up Samsung",5
Samsung Health,Really cool app. It tracks legit anything I need.. I'm just upset that they took the caffeine button away. (There's a option to choose how many cups of water you drink.) Personally I would love the coffee section to come back....,3
Samsung Health,"Since update, steps not linking through to MyFitnessPal as they always have done previously. Can see your reply but we are UK so no,sorry not calling that number. Can see people have commented on myfitnesspal app reviews re same issue so something going on between the 2 systems",3
Samsung Health,"Please return the caffeine intake tracking. Have I permanently lost my data I've been recording daily for over a year in my Galaxy Watch Active 2? It's gone from the watch too, after software update. It used to be among Top 3 functions I have been using my smart watch for.",4
Samsung Health,I love this app! I walk a lot and it tracks my steps wonderfully. I also monitor my other health stats for my doctor. Makes it super easy to give my info. I love the global challenges,5
LG Health,"This is an applicable widget, but I found a shortage on it. For example, during daily activity, while I'm in the car, the widget is still counting my steps, while I'm not walking. So I suggest you to put some useful keys on the widget i.e. play/pause/stop, in order to use this application just during exercise or at the time that we need do some activites",3
LG Health,"The stupid app keeps logging me out if I don't open it at least twice a day. I've tried to check my steps progress and found it hadn't recorded the last 3 days, then it tells me I'm not as active. It's functionality is fine while it's working but it shuts itself down with no warning and quits recording. I'm thoroughly annoyed",2
LG Health,"Sometimes I feel it didn't register the exact records of my daily walking. Moreover, it has grammatical errors in it's messages such as move forwards instead of move forward! However, I can't ignore it's positive impacts on me. It really encourage me to exercise and move by it's nice quotes",4
LG Health,The app needs to allow for the customer to be able to add the information on the types of exercises even if it the day after. This app does not allow to add information if you forgot to do it on the specific day. Also is too light. They need to af more features.,2
LG Health,"Horribly inaccurate. Tried to use this multiple times, in multiple locations, while doing multiple types of excercises and it doesn't even come close to measuring steps, speeds or distances accurately. Completely useless app.",1
LG Health,New glitch since the last update! The app no longer shows past days where I fulfilled my water drinking challenge :-(. It just looks like I haven't drank any water for the whole week.,1
LG Health,I use and rely on LG Health. Daily. I excercise 7 days a .this is great helpful app. Thank u🗽💫🌹,5
LG Health,Very accurate step count. Within 25 inches. Lousy complicatef UI.,1
LG Health,Your water intake memory is not working.,4
LG Health,"Very overrated. Doesn't jive with GPS, gets lost along routes. Very disappointng.",2
LG Health,Very good app which gives details sbt cal. burnt on ur particular activity etc,5
LG Health,"You should be able to choose whether or not you want to have this app on you phone. There should be a sign in option as well. If you want to erase the data you've entered that should be an option as well. Nowadays people are using their smartwatches to track their fitness. Stop prompting me to update an app I don't want to use, it's taking up space.",1
LG Health,"It is a pedometer for the most part. It doesn't sync with any devices so you must have your phone on you at all times (I don't). You can track basic fitness like walking, running and cycling. Personally, I use Samsung Health on my LG G850 along with a Galaxy watch. They work well on the LG.",2
LG Health,"This is the most useless app. If I try to uninstall it, it freezes my phone, repeatedly. Because of this app, which came pre-downloaded on my phone, I will NEVER get another LG phone as i never want this app wasting space on my phone again.",1
LG Health,Please increase the font size and contrast of info on the widget. There is plenty of room for a larger font. The white letters against the gray background make it even harder to read. Also the number of steps is unreadable in both colors because of the font and the bright colors. Thank you.,4
LG Health,"Lost almost 3,000 steps behind Google Fit today. I have emailed you before. Nothing is done. My GPS is set to maximize the accuracy. Also you shouldn't post stuff that we can't Cut and Paste or click on. Your app is terrible lately. I am about to get a new phone. It won't be a LG phone. Bye Felicia after 8 LG phones I am done with you. Switching to a Samsung!",1
LG Health,"Love this app, especially the option to enter other exercises when phone is not able to be carried on my body such as when doing aerobics, swimming, etc. Can you make this exact app in iPhone version. Did many searches looking for this app in the Apple store, could not find anything close to it.",5
LG Health,"I think it's a simple exercise app, which works best for running, jogging, bicycling, and other outdoor type activities. Works well for hiking too, since I can track routes. I would classify the widgets as fairly weak , but the app itself is usable.",3
LG Health,"Hi Team, Excellent app, but below 2 ootions are critical: Can you please - 1) Include an option to KEEP SCEEN ON while the app is open ? 2) Have a simple 2x1 widget to just show steps completed for the day ? The only widget now is 5x2 which takes too much of screen space! Thx in advance.",2
LG Health,"The tracking on this app is horrible. I used it to record my progress for a few of weeks but only stored a fraction of my runs. At first I thought it was my phone's gps so I recalibrated it and restarted my phone; however, that did not solve the problem. Afterwards, I synched my phone with a fitbit to see if it worked and it did. Using this app was very frustrating.",1
LG Health,This app used to be very accurate and useful. But for the past few weeks it does not record and track my cycling or hiking properlly which makes this pretty much useless.,2
LG Health,This app is very simple and spot-on to use. Clearly shows how much walking I do get at work everyday which is consistently between 8 and 12000 steps. You deserve nothing less than five stars.,5
LG Health,"Inability to customize or edit activities and logs really impacts usability. Also can't seem to log events from day before if you go past midnight, which is baffling. EDIT: You know, these standardized, boilerplate ""responses"" are utterly meaningless and don't help to improve your image as a company. None of my complaints are something you could help me with via email; they are fundamental flaws in the software that you've ignored for over 4 years.",2
LG Health,"This app is useful for the level I need to track (keeping a rough idea of weight and activity levels.) Some updates I would love to see are being able to see more than a weeks stats in one go, being able to edit and delete entries (since I often add them in wrong!) and being able to enter in excersise from the previous day, for those times that I forget to enter in something that I did. Altogether a really useful, low pressure way to get an idea of your activity levels, though. Would recommend.",4
LG Health,"Alright app, not bad but missing so many things that Samsung Health offers and would definitely benefit from adding these features and perhaps a UI update to fit LG UX 9.0 as it has barely changed in all the time I've had my G6",3
LG Health,"Crappy app. Don't use it! Once downloaded, it won't allow you to delete it. Info irritatingly always visible on your main screen. Can't delete! My Fit Bit app is MUCH more useful.",1
LG Health,"It's a useless app when you can't edit logs from the previous days. Example, I was at the gym yesterday and wanted to add that but can't because it's not editable after the next day. Another example, I was skiing last week and wanted to go back and include that but can't, only because I didn't change it on the day.",2
LG Health,"UPDATE: 7/20/-20; This app does not work. I was laying in bed Saturday morning, picked up my phone from off the headboard it already said I walked 76 steps and I hadn't went anywhere so it was counting ghost steps which means when I did get up and start walking it was 76 steps off. Changed to a 1-Star. *OLD POST: Samsung Health app is more of a health app than LG's Health app. LG's app is more of a tracking app not health app. Example: Samsung Health -vs- LG Health Calorie count.",1
LG Health,"Haven't used this app much yet but i like it for the most part but sometimes it just will not keep track of things, ill set something and when i go back to it it'll be gone.",3
LG Health,"Does not track everthing, especially going up floors. Other than that, it's a great assistance tool.",3
LG Health,"I said this is Bloat Ware, it doesn't matter which model phone - we should have the option to totally uninstall and remove anything related to this app. We can't and therefore it's Bloat Ware. No App that isn't completely necessary to run the operation system should be permanently installed. If we don't want it, it's taking up unnecessary space",1
LG Health,The gps tracker records me going over houses. It never tracks my exact trail i take which is always on sidewalks. Most of the time when i start my app it does not even track nothing i come to notice it when i finish. So it did not record nothing. Really bad app i am searching for another one and removing this one forever.,1
LG Health,"You are not able to input daily weights. I do like that you can look back at previous days if you forget to look at the end of the day. My notification was in my notifications bar the first day, but day two it disappeared with no option to bring it back. Disappointing.",3
LG Health,"This app came with my lg g4. When I switched to my galaxy s8 and saw their version, I was glad to find this app worked on it. Contains no ads. Tracks runs and bicycle trips and shows nice maps and stats. I have used it while in the caribbean and Europe when I was in airplane mode and it still worked.",5
LG Health,"Something's up - the last few days the app says I'm far exceeding my steps goal - great! Except I know it's not true. I may be getting a few more steps in at work because of extra COVID duties, but no way is it over 15000. Checked it against Google Fit and it's been recording 3 times my actual steps.",2
LG Health,"I am new to the use of LG equipment. In addition I also have not logged into the application. On the off-chance this is not already integrated into the programming of this application, The Entity LG should add almost like an on demand section on this application for exercises and health-related video programming from known participants in the field. This way you can utilize the funding acquired in a charitable way to offer a ""Free/Pre"" section, better yet ""Limited"" Utlise the screen Casting -Z",3
LG Health,"I hate this app. I wish that I could remove it from my phoneor stop getting notifications. It does not record my steps accurately and my fitbit is much better. Today it verbally beat me up for taking 8000 steps....""it's a nice day for a walk. .Let's get out and exercise"". That is at 10:00 am. Utter b.s.",1
LG Health,"Good app, especially that I have LG G7 ThinQ phone. One problem: when I reboot the phone, I have to open again the app. Please advise.",4
LG Health,"Annoying. Wish the app let me add the speed and distance along with time when tracking exercise like running. When tracking excercise manually, if I enter incorrect time, the app doesn't allow to edit and correct the time.",1
LG Health,Worked great the first few days but now its not recording all my steps. Luckily i had another app for back up.,1
LG Health,"* First of all, this is an unreliable step/activity counter. **And second, this app program contributes absolutely NOTHING to the functionality of these phones. So WHY isn't there the option to TOTALLY REMOVE this app from OUR PHONES!?! THIS COMPLETELY UNNECESSAR preinstalled application-which serves NO viable role in system operations, performance NOR improves concept, ease of useage, etc. BLOATWARE occupies valuable storage space that the purchaser could better utilize. Where's our choices?",1
LG Health,"I would like to be able to turn this off. I have other apps for this because they all sync together; this one doesn't. The fact that it's always there on my notification bar is annoying and it's draining my battery faster than before. It doesn't even register things correctly. I figured since I was stuck with it I'd try out one of the challenges and picked the stair climb challenge. I just spent 25 minutes running/walking up and down the stairs at my house; it only registered 8 floors.",2
LG Health,"It used to be a good app, but only until Dec 14th update. I would give it 4-5 stars, now it is only one, sorry, but someone on the product side srewed this app up (read all other reviews from latest). All those notifications are misleading and should not be there in the first place. Now you do not know what this app is doing in the background. Android's policies? Nonsense. I disabled this app and then re-enabled again, and all my data from the last 1.5 years is gone. Horrible experience.",1
LG Health,"I want LG Health deleted from my phone because unless you have your phone on you at all times, the number of steps that you have taken that day is totally incorrect!!",1
LG Health,Once you open the app you literally can't get rid of it. I opened it just to see what it was and now I get daily updates that I can't dismiss. Very frustrating.,1
LG Health,"I really like the app, but there should be a wider variety of sports that can be selected for exercise logs, such as wrestling or soccer, and other workouts like push ups, pull ups, sit up, general calisthenics and the like. It also is not always very accurate, such as when I rode my bike 10 miles but it said I walked 1,000 steps. Also, if I forget to log my afternoon swimming (I'm on swim team), I can't log it the next day or the day after (I'm not always on my phone).",3
LG Health,"Horrible. When an app can't handle the most basic of functions I give it the lowest possible rating every time! When I do exercises like eliptical or stairs and enter them, half the time I can go back into the app and it has disappeared! If I forget to go back in and manually enter it, I LOSE the record of that exercise for good! You can't go in and add it the next day. It's like you never did it. It is also very complicated even entering an exercise. You put the starting time and then minutes.",1
LG Health,This widget sometimes just stops tracking steps. It is annoying.,3
LG Health,"I like the app over all. Im not a health nut but it is nice to track my steps per day and reach my goals. This latest update has upset me thoroughly. I would very much like as a user to have the OPTION to have my app in my notifications rather than forced. I don't check my stats every single time i use my phone and it is distracting having a notification at all times. Please make it an optional feature with the next update. If not I'm sorry to say it, but I will find another application.",2
LG Health,"this app needs a schedule feature so it isn't telling you to go outside during the middle of the work day. also, I keep my phone with me for music when i go to the gym, so when I'm on a stationary bike it counts the steps and throws off my count for when I actually do try to keep track of my numbers. Some sort of overwrite feature would be great.",2
LG Health,"Trash! Your most recent update destroyed what was a great and simple app. It's now useless!! It goes active whenever it wants to, and stops tracking whenever it wants to. It will not allow you to set a duration, every time you try to to, it says exercise cannot end after now!!!! It use to automatically track 24 hours a day, you didn't have to do anything, now it's utterly useless. Way to screw up a good thing.",1
LG Health,"This is my first health/exercise tracking app, so I'm still figuring it out. So far, it's been a bit confusing putting in different exercises. I would rather put in how many sit-ups or squats I did rather than for how long I did them. I also have had to substitute, for example, squats for all my dif. leg exercises. Or push-ups for all my arm & chest exercises, & again, all in minutes. Another thing that's odd, is that I walk my treadmill for 30 min, but it translates as only 23 min of walking-??",3
LG Health,"Does not show total ""steps"" for a day in the logs, only totals for each type of activity; it would make sense to show the overall daily total. Also, not very good at recording ""climbing"", often does not at all. Certainly does not record steps accurately. The calorie count, as well, is off. Finally, the ""record exercise type"" selector is in a silly spot; too easy to accidentally turn off, as I have. It should be under ""settings"". However, as it really is a basic, and simple, app I can live with the inaccurate recording. I use it only as a general guideline for my activity, but not showing overall daily totals of all steps, including what it calls ""converted"" steps, is a shortcoming that should be corrected. Otherwise, not so bad.",3
LG Health,"Gets to 100,% then goes crazy! The front screen flashes with congratulations, but then immediately goes to the normal screen, which then shows only about half of my time and distance",1
LG Health,"It seems to be the consensus that the latest update seriously screwed up this otherwise good app. Ive been using it for many years on different LG phones and have relied on it. Now, for example, I was hiking all weekend and the app was calculating that I was walking over 100 miles instead of the 15 I actually did. It would count steps while I slept, even. I uninstalled all updates and seems to be working again. But this needs fixed, ASAP.",2
LG Health,Not accurate at all with the distance of walks or runs!!! I just walked 4.9miles it says 2.66km or 1.65mi.... the firehouse is 1.25mi from my house(so says google maps and my odometer) and i walked at least 3x farther than that!!!!,1
LG Health,"Good app but there isn't anywhere directly in the app to report issues. I've contacted the help desk and was able to get a fast response and suggestions to resolve an issue. Overall it's a very productive app. If you are consistently unable to meet your goals it will suggest setting a lower goal and adjust it for you. Unfortunately this app will insult you if you're not up to par. It will say things like, ""you're capable of doing more"".. This isnt encouraging for someone that has a disability.",3
LG Health,It's a decent app. I wish it would show how fast i am walking and running. And do a better job at tracking activity. I've had samsung health for quite some time now and personnally i believe it is set up better. I can down load it to my LG V40 thinQ but i would like to get a better knowledge of the LG health app. Maybe i'm doing something wrong. Anyway its a decent app,2
LG Health,Is very challenging but it make you want to do better by looking at it everyday are remind you to drink your water so I like it enjoy,5
LG Health,Great App with lots of features. Mine was built into the phone and I have had no issues with it until this new update. I really do not like that it stays in my notification bar and that deleting the notification gives me another telling me its running in the background. I hate that the little icon just sits there burning itself into the screen. The onlt way to stop it is to force stop the app which causes complications. Please change this.,4
LG Health,"I do like the concept. NO BATTERY DRAIN 4 Me! IDK what others 🤔!?! Perhaps installed or Updated another app & Blame LG! (idoits) The fact that I No Way to add previous readings. I have taken weight,B.P.,Etc readings, but forgot to enter! This new notification system pisses me off. Ni way to choose which or different sounds for notices..? I have determined this might be an LG issue or just the software on my LG V30+? It does do its job like it should minus some quirks.",3
LG Health,I dont like the changes made to the app. You cant see a daily history of steps walked and before it was in the circle instead of a bar. Also frustrating that to cant edit your activity,1
LG Health,"I just ran around for like 3 hours, and didn't record even 1/4 of it. It's not the first time either, meanwhile it says that it is always on. Also it says an ideal weight for me is 166lbs, meanwhile it obviously doesn't account for muscle mass. truthfully I believe a healthy weight for me would be around 190-195. Jow do you change it?",1
LG Health,"The app used to be great and I used it every day. But after the new Oct. '19 Android uppate this app started permently taking up a space in the notification bar. It is always there and cant be removed. They LIE and say ""According to Google policies, From the Oreo OS, LG Health app alerts are always displayed in the notification window."" There is NO SUCH REQUIREMENT. So I am uninimstalling it, since I only want reminders to drink water and I DO not want it taking up space in my notification bar.",1
LG Health,"Minmal usage (only turned it on to see what it was.) prevents me from commenting as to its worth. It seems okay but as stated, minimal usage.",3
LG Health,"It works fine, but I wish their was a way to edit activities after you've logged them",3
LG Health,"This app is horrible. It doesn't track steps accuratley. I work for a delivery company and have always used an app to track my steps. Since I switched to Adroid, I started using this app to track my progress. It shows that I'm cycling when I am cruising a package truck at 40 mph. A couple days this week it logged me at 24 miles of walking. This is not for the week. It was 24 miles everyday. Using app on LG Stylo 4 on T-Mobile network.
",1
LG Health,The calibration on this app constantly goes haywire and it will not track my actual movement accurately.,1
LG Health,"I'm unable to delete this app. I had everything on it disabled but after a new OS update it's back and harder to get rid of then ever before. Also, don't be fooled by disabling everything on the app. When my OS changed this app showed months of previous tracked steps and data that is shouldn't have had access to. If I can't find a way to stop it or delete it altogether this will be my last LG phone.",1
LG Health,Awesome for tracking exercise. Like the UI It would be great if could integrate with the galaxy warch,5
LG Health,This app has stopped as of 6/26/2020...will not update nor will it record steps...just think I have used this app for over 5 years...dont know what upgrade they did but this app now sucks.I am now deleting it off my phone permently,1
LG Health,Since last update very high step count inaccuracy. And draining the battery pn my G6 in about 6 hours. Accounted for 56% of battery use in the background even with battery saver on. And can't hide the display screen. It stays there even when you select Clear All. I have disabled the app. And i am ready ti delete and loose over 4 years of data. BAD APP.,1
LG Health,"Layout is phenomenal. Latest update broke my tracker. Not tracking flights of stairs which is super frustrating because I'm participating in the LG Health App's stair climbing challenge. I paced for a full hour and the app didn't record a single step from it. Also doesn't let you pick which exercise you want your daily challenges to be. just gives you a list of 5 . Why on earth would anyone choose that limitation? Edit: I already emailed support. ""We do not currently have that feature"".",2
LG Health,"I love this app! I used it for at least 3 years with my other phone. When buying a new phone this week and trying another app; it couldn't match the LG Health app. I searched it out and installed it. Now I once again; have an app, which is easy to use, while keeping track of the number of steps I do each day/week. Yay!",5
LG Health,"i quite like this app. However since the most recent update of this app (I'm on Oreo), there seems to be a problem with the accuracy of the app, even when the phone doesn't move it records steps being taken, not sure if this is a bug on the app or the Oreo OS, because this has never happened to me previously with this app. But as a whole its good at keeping record of your activities.",5
LG Health,"• It's just not the same! I have it on me, at all times, at work and have the exact same schedule every week, but it's such a vast difference lately? Lately, my distance; steps & stairs have decreased & changed significantly. Sadly, it just doesn't seem to be as accurate as it once was? Please fix!",2
LG Health,"When it works properly, it's a great tool. However, it Crashes frequently. Doesn't always detect location and therefore does not always accurately track and record exercise. Does not allow for edits on previous days. For example, if i forget to log my water intake for the day, I can't go back the next day and update my log from the previous day.",3
LG Health,for some reason does not keep track of steps when my phone is locked. G7 ThinQ. body sensor and location permissions checked. Edit: notifications need to be on for it to work better,3
LG Health,Terrible as it does not include cycling. Only way is to edit log on the same day. This app needs a lot of improvement.,1
LG Health,"An easy-to-use app. I haven't yet verified its accuracy. My main gripe: WHAT GOOD IS IT IF YOU CANNOT COPY OR BACKUP THE DATA locally? Sure, you can do that if you sync. the data to the cloud, but I don't want my personal health data in the cloud. With all the security issues nowadays, that's not smart.",4
LG Health,"Have loved using this app, but I've just updated my phone and a notification that apparently cannot be removed has come up on my phone saying this app is running int he background. I want it to be running all the time as that's the whole point of this app. But I may have to disable LG Health to get rid of the stupid notification!!!",1
LG Health,I did at least half an hour walking yesterday and it did not register a single step.,2
LG Health,"Updated my app this morning and now it says I've been walking for almost 6 hours today. I haven't gotten up for the day but I'm killing my steps at 38,600 while staying in bed... who knew working out was going to be so easy! I can't find a way to change the steps it recorded incorrectly and there's no real help feature. Also not a fan of having the constant notification icon so I turned that off. It is completely unnecessary.",1
LG Health,"it works ok. but not great. today i got a message "" you've been slowing down the last three months pick up the pace."" that was this morning 5 mins ago it said ""your constantly hitting your goals maybe it's time to increase the."" it's okay to run sense it's it the background and doesn't use allot of juice but for health people who want all the right info you'll need something else.",3
LG Health,First got this app with my LG phone and it worked well. Later updates then broke the stair climbing measurement so that it consistently under estimated the number of floors climbed (it got confused because I do two stairs at a time I think). I use tha stair climbing part a lot. The latest update removed that function altogether which makes it useless for me. Not happy.,2
LG Health,"Inaccurate step counting since last update. For example, my morning walk with the dogs takes about 20 minutes and usually took about 1100-1300 steps. Now it says I took >6000 steps and walked ~4 miles in that 20 minutes! Right now, it's just afternoon and I've already reached about 12000 steps in ~40 minutes of walking over 10 miles, according to the app. Um, no, especially if I needed a 5-foot stride to do that.",1
LG Health,"overall its OK I would like to be able to input data about previous weigh ins without having to do it on the day though. it seems very counter intuitive. the menus are a little confusing too and I had to go to the lg website just to figure a few things out. it seems to need simplifying and reorganizing, and a few features adding. such as weight inputting, calorie tracking, etc. also the constant notification is super annoying...",3
LG Health,"great idea, spotty implementation. I love the logging aspect and the ideal weight calculation and the calorie counting but... it sufferers the same flaw as lesser fitness apps do: spotty tracking of your running. maybe I'm just slow, but this app confuses running with walking, despite staying in my front pants pocket for the whole jog. Good thing i can manually define the type of exercise I'm currently doing (and there's a VERY wide selection @.@)",5
LG Health,Can’t sign in to account to sync my activities. I play Pokémon Go and can’t hatch eggs cause it doesn’t track my walking with this app.,1
LG Health,"Worst thing: the ""ideal weight"" is medical nonsense (ideal range would at least be better). If you look past that, and enjoy having it track activity, it still has problems, e.g. today, a month after I started using, it sent an alert that I've ""been getting less active over the past 3 months."" No indication of what (erroneous) data that's based on. Over-counts (maybe a physical problem with the hardware) and has no means of correcting glaring errors (reports biking 2 mi while on an airplane).",1
LG Health,"This is so motivational. Especially the live widget. Every time i turn on my screen, i can see how many steps have i been taking for the day. Feature requests. 1. Graph/ log daily steps, weekley logs, yearly logs and so on. 2. Reminder for how long have i been not taking any steps . 3. More motivational quotes.",5
LG Health,"Works fine until my phone dies/restart my phone, then I have to delete the app, wait a few hours then re-download it and restart all my progress.",2
LG Health,I use the app all of the time but there is no category for general calisthenics when logging your exercise. A lot of the exercise I do is body weight exercise but it is usually varied (not just pushups or situps). It would be nice if I could easily log my workouts. Also I have notices a delay in tracking your activity since the last OS update. Sometimes information doesn't show up until the next day which can throw you off if you have daily targets.,3
LG Health,"Does not record steps on a Stylo 4 (it did on a Stylo 3 but this app is broken on a Stylo 4). I tried to get support from LG and multiple people told me there isnt any problem. UPDATE: LG, instead of using the same copy and paste response, how about reading the actual review and addressing what the user says?!?!?",1
LG Health,"Doesn't track about 1/3 of my steps. Doesn't register upper body movement and I do a lot of bending, lifting, and twisting at work. Uses the BMI which has been proven inaccurate. However, it does allow me to include activities like dance and horseback riding which other apps don't. Also defaults to beginner mode when you get a new phone.",3
LG Health,The GPS on the App that is in my LG G7+ is not accurate and has a difference of 40% compare to Google Maps. It is also not as user friendly as a NRC or Runtastic apps.,1
LG Health,"used to love the app but now with it permantly showing in notification without the possibility of ""swiping left"" to remove the notification it sucks. I don't want to see it all day every day if or if I haven't done whatever exercise. Please fix this annoying issue. Right now I prefer the app disabled due to this and will only turn it on if and when I actually need it. Thanks for a great app and thanks for ruining it.
",1
LG Health,This app is very unaccurate. I pick up my phone off of the nightstand and it says I walked 11 steps. I am still in bed! Definitely deleting it abd finding a better health/walking app. And now I can't get it off of my phone. I don't want it and it needs I need the ability to delete it off of my phone period!,1
LG Health,"it's okay for a free app. doesn't know if your running, walking, or cycling. when trying to add an exercise manually, it won't allow you to add something after the time you completed it OR before the current time. so basically, you can't add anything. lol. it's very frustrating.",2
LG Health,"It seems to record steps you don't take...I don't mean one or two, It goes absolutely crazy and zigzags across the map a when using the track walking feature. Also, once you open the app, you can never turn it off. I am sure it still counts steps when I am either in the car or train when without tracking enabled. Absolutely dreadful app!!!",1
LG Health,"Was working fine untill latest android version downloaded & installed on my LG G6. Version is VS98830a, aka ""pie"". App is seriosly inflating steps, delayed recognition of activity, and counting steps when doing no activity (even with phone laying on counter). Can no longer trust it, effectively useless now. Follow up.: I got same response others did. I'm confused I gave phone model and software its running. I had to dig, but LG Health version is 5.40.16 - maybe that is whats needed.",2
LG Health,"Not enough instructions, tips did not provide how to stop it from continualy running. I only want it on when I am actually using it. I am supposed to count my steps, measure the lenght I walked and how much time it took when finished. The app keeps counting 27/7 even when I am in my wheelchair. This runs down my battery.",1
LG Health,"Since the latest update this step tracker has been very inaccurate... I use both this and Google Fit. They used to be within 100 steps or so every day. Now, LG Health is running about 5000 (yes 5000) steps behind Google Fit. It's too bad, because I used to like LG Health much better than Google Fit. Screw it. Now it has stopped counting anything. Not sorry to say I am deleting this app permanently.",1
LG Health,"My 7th day with this application. It successfully impaired the operation of my phone gradually until I could only do basics. In addition, it is the deceptive and misleading. I was looking for an app for health but they portray financial gain by simply logging your healthy activity but on the 7th day your success is ""reset"". Furthermore, they hide the name of the app on your phone so its difficult to find it on the play store again. My icon is labeled step younger + pro. Its actually LG health.",1
LG Health,"OK at Best! I use this along with mt FITBIT Versa every day and the difference in tracking is by a tremendous amount. I'm talking acc couple of miles at times. 2-3K steps. At times I'll just accept the challenge and get what i need to complet my goal for this app. BUT, something is clearly off with the app. In my most humble opinion.",3
LG Health,"Failing constantly. About two weeks ago the app stopped tracking any exercise. I have updated, disabled and enabled back, no result. The app just stopped working! Very dissaponted, I've always thought this was a decent app. After trying any possibility, I finally give up trying to make it work again. Unluckily I cannot deinstall the app; I have an LG smartphone and this is not possible. I can only disable the app, which I have done. And it'll stay disabled from now on.",1
LG Health,"if I could give this app zero Stars I would. Number one BMI is an inaccurate way to measure how your body's health is, it only measures weight height and the length around your stomach, it doesn't take into account the amount of muscle-which by the way is denser than fat and therefore weighs more. in addition this app recommended that I eat 450 cal per day, I know that algae covers their butts by using a statement saying that they are not medically certified, but this is downright dangerous.",1
LG Health,"I love LG, I think they make good products. Ever since I bought the G4 phone I continued buying them, now I own the G6 and bought the G8 for my mom. The problem with this app is that there is no way to turn it on and off so it gives you wrong data. I have tried in many ways, but I can't (or don't know how) so I have to un install it. Too bad, because they force you to use another one from a different company.",1
LG Health,This was working great and I was starting to get in shape but now it doesn't open at all. It will not open and I don't know what to do.,2
LG Health,"This update makes your crappier (compared to Samsung's) health ap intolerable for me. Whoever thought of this idea- constantly draining even more battery power from your phone- should be fired. It was already kind of harassing, but now I have a constant reminder of the fact that im disabled (and cannot walk as much as id like to) that I cant turn off!",1
LG Health,I wish the app could distinct between walking and driving. I keep forgeetting to turn it on and odd. I really love it other than that.,5
LG Health,Great app but recent update has stopped autodetect cycling. Previously sometimes detected cycling whilst driving slowly and repeatedly depressing clutch: possibly thrown baby out with bathwater? However other features are better than the Samsung equivalent even on Samsung device. Allows recording of many different exercise types. Tracks route without making public. Use it every day.,5
LG Health,"Tracking is not that accurate. If u repeate the path, tracking fails to calculate total walking distance . Also no audible distance announcement.",3
LG Health,prior version showed incorrect amt. of cycling and doesnt allow any corrections. The listed exercize categories are also limited to 'recreational' types. Some of us get a large portion of exercize from other activities such as wood cutting / splitting and manual snow removal both of which can be light and heavy. These are more active than walking.,3
LG Health,"Tried it a few times and the steo counter is way off. 1/2 mile off according to the running machine at my gym. That is a lot. It uses a lot of battery, constantly on and constantly getting the same click bait message. "" BIG TEMPERATURE SWINGS EXPECTED IN YOUR AREA"" even though I am not. And to read LG health messages can't be turned off but only minimized is very annoying. I can't even turn this thing off.",1
LG Health,"The manual entry is not editable after you save it. Also it doesn't give you the option to input distance on treadmill run and it over estimates how many steps you ran since it is only based on time. You also can't go back and add activities in the past if you forgot to document some activity. I think the steps walked is accurate, and I like that you can track weight and set goals. Just wished my treadmill runs were more accurately documented, would be nice to see my average pace.",3
LG Health,"I use this app daily to meet my daily goal of 10,500 steps. I have a Pixel3aXL running the latest update of Android and it works great. The only thing I would like to see is for the app to sync more often so that the line graph stays up to date. As it is, now, to update the graph I have to go into settings, change from Advanced to Auto, then back to Advanced. Also, a few years ago, when I hit my goal, I got a notification. That no longer seems to be a function. Be great if it was brought back.",4
LG Health,"Moderately useful bloatware. LG forces this app on you and you can't uninstall. I was ok with occasional notifications at certain mileage or step milestones. Then LG decides to use forced notifications so when you glance at your phone, you think you got a call for a second. Waste of screen space. So then you disable notifications, but then you don't get the milestone notifications. All or nothing. Would have been 4 stars, forced notifications on forced bloatware makes it 2 stars.",2
LG Health,Agree With Mr Law Wildly inaccurate step counting since last update. For example MY long morning walk is around 7000 steps or at least it used to be until the last update. Now it register over 9000. Same route different count and when I look at the step count often times the count is going up by 200 step increments as i watch it. this used to be a helpful app but not anymore.,2
LG Health,Dear developer. Would you mind telling us why cycling and stair activity recognize counter removed from this app?,1
LG Health,"No longer syncs with Google fit, and cant even switch the sync off and on to force it, which used to work. Why does that trigger a ""network not available"" error?",1
LG Health,"Not really a very good app. Lots of activities are not even covered in the app. Like ergonometers. while it's a good concept, it's really a bare bones kind of app, that seems specifically targeted at a small population of users. It can't compare with Google Fit.",3
LG Health,"The update is absoutely ridiculous. The fact that it is always displayed is ridiculous. I disabled my notifications and its still in my notifications bar telling me that it is draining battery. I hate having notifications on due to the cluttering in the notifications bar. This bothers me and needs to be fixed. I never leave bad reviews. This needs to be fixed, this policy is ridiculous",1
LG Health,"This application is quite good for tracking sport activities. It can automatically track walking, you can set it easily to track cycling, running, ... and you can log your exercises. Minus: But log is not editable so that is minus one star for me. Neutral: Compared to other apps this one doesn't have online account.",4
LG Health,"Good idea, poor implementation - it is supposed to have training plans, but: it doesn't remember how much water you drink after the day you drank it (e.g. today I record 4.5 litres, tomorrow I see blank for today, or today it shows me 55%, tomorrow only 8% are there); same for running + many times it is recorded as walking, so I keep failing it; calories are poorly calculated; the steps feature works decently after a couple of years of frustration. I have an LG G3 and I hope you improve the app.",3
LG Health,"I like the simplicity of this app and the gps tracking feature for outdoor runs etc. However, I wish you could add workouts to previous days. I like to track my activity weekly and sometimes I forget to input a workout for the day. If this feature is added I would give five stars.",2
LG Health,"The tracking on the app is way off. I use an lg g7. When I'm jogging it's legit telling me that I'm jogging diagonally through houses. It's not showing me that I'm jogging along streets or sidewalks. The layout of the app is great though, I will be installing another health app that will hopefully work better. Lg you should fix these issues.",1
LG Health,This use to be a great app to keep up with my walking progress. The new update slams it right up on the icon tray and it begins to use the battery at a rate that i have to keep my phone plugged in. I have to force stop the app. Can't delete it because it is a system app.,1
LG Health,"I have changed phones twice now and it has been IMPOSSIBLE to get my data when making the change. It shouldn't be this hard or this frustrating. I don't really love the app, but I would like to some how keep going with the data I once had. Very frustrating!!",1
LG Health,I love(d) this app! I cannot believe that cycling and stair climbing is being taken away! It makes no sense! Why would you need to do that? I loved the stair climbing feature especially as it actually motivated me to climb instead of taking the elevator.,3
LG Health,"This app was working well, but now the last several days it hasn't stored any of my water intake. I check it right before bed and it says I made my goal only for me to put my first glass in the next day and see no water from previous days. It's really frustrating when trying to see if I've hit my goal for the week.",3
LG Health,This app seems to have frozen. It deleted more than 5000 steps. I am going to delete it and download it again. I kind of like it.,3
LG Health,"Was great until recent updates. Now I am constantly getting notifications that LG health not logged in or sync causing a Google 403 error to constantly pop up on my phone all day long! Evertime I turn on my phone screen, it's on the Google 403 error page. Please fix this! I love LG health, but if this continues, I'll uninstall.",2
LG Health,How this bloatware got onto my Moto E4 I have no idea.... I can only assume it piggy backed on the remote for my TV. Bad joojoo LG.,1
LG Health,"This is the absolute WORST step counter ever! It counts about 2/3 of the steps you do, and stays halted on one count for MINUTES while you are still walking or running, as if it stalls out. I have been making my step count goal daily for over a month, yet i feel as if ive done at least 33% more steps than my goal, just to reach my goal. I cannot recommend. Edit: so I installed another tracker to run along w/LG...today so far, that tracker is 110 steps up on the LG tracker for the SAME walk!",2
LG Health,"I like the app, but I wish I could edit the days before or even the current days activity. Where you can log the type of exercise it would be great if there was an option for cleaning, I don't always have my phone physically on me while I do and if I log that I was walking then it way over calculates my steps.",3
LG Health,"Great app but can use some improvements. I like the goals and workout tracker. I do NOT like the inaccurate daily step counter, when the phone isnt always on me and false steps from movement or vibrations of my phone. Also can use more exercise options **examples** cleaning house yard work shopping",3
LG Health,I have been using this app for a few years. However it no longer maps my walks or bike rides. Looking fir a new app that does,2
LG Health,"I could like this app, but why does it only displays steps on the days that already passed? It would be much more better if it displayed the distance too next to the steps or something, not just the overall distance of the month on the top and the steps/climb/run separated to days withouth the distance..",3
LG Health,This app does not update regularly. Also adding many steps I didnt takr and combining yesterdays count with today! I can't uninstall it.,1
LG Health,"I enjoy keeping track of stuff. The pedometor is NOT accurate, however. I KNOW the sensors on my phone are good, being a brand new phone & all. That & the giration works just jim dandy for anything else I need it for. So, may to check into that... Otherwise, good little app. :-}",4
LG Health,Still won't let me delete it. I shouldn't have to email LG and beg to have it uninstalled. Just enable the Uninstall button and let me remove this garbage bloatware myself.,1
LG Health,Very Inaccurate steps . Even compared with another tracker same time same set up. It also uses alot of batter life.,1
LG Health,Poorly...its decrease too much battery power..i have to recharge my phone more often after upgrading this app,1
LG Health,"Can't stand the fact that it now stays in my task bar constantly. As others have said, phones not with me constantly to begin with but now we're stuck having an icon. I've downloaded a separate, more accurate, app for my tracking which runs when I need it to rather than consistently draining battery.",1
LG Health,"I did like this app, but it now gives a crazy number of steps. It used to be broadly similar to other apps, which is what I would expect, but it is now inaccurate to the point of being silly and completely useless. Please fix so I can use it again!",2
LG Health,"I like that it keeps track and gives little tips and notes. However, I do wish I could edit exercise when I've added it manually, mistakes do happen. I'd rate it higher if I could also choose which day I did something afterwards, since I often forget to put it in.",3
LG Health,Cumbersome to use. No Help on input. Weight cant be seen to show progress. The step progress is great.,3
LG Health,"I would love this app if it had more exercises on the list- specifically hula hooping, quad skating, and roller derby.",3
LG Health,So far I love this app. Easy to use and understand. Ready to follow and push myself with. The only thing I need to go outside the app for is a female health calendar to maintain my cycle. Would be awesome if LG Health added that for half the population.,4
LG Health,Terrible quality. I can put my phone on the floor and it will show me racking up hundreds of steps per minute.,1
LG Health,"This app sucks, no where near enough stats. Why can't you look at your history and see how many miles you walked with total steps taken without having to add them up yourself? Way better apps for tracking steps. Needs a lot of improvement.",1
LG Health,"I cant blame this app is kind of helpful but if u want the reason why i rate it 3 Stars because the traking of this app is slow, yes is and that is the rthing that made me mad of this app, but to the bright side this app encourages alot, like for example, every month sebd u a note telling you how many kg did you lose also calories AND alot of that, but in THE end i decided that i well delete it.",3
LG Health,Used to use this app daily til the update. Not going to be forced to look at a notification that cant be cleared. Should be pretty simple to put in an option to always show or not. Until they do this app has gone from daily use to disabled without hesitation.,1
LG Health,"Since last update step count is way off. I have used other apps. to confirm this. In addition the app used to be to able tell the difference between driving and walking, it no longer can. App was great and accurate until last update.",1
LG Health,Love the app & love the new notification bar tracker but soon after this update my phone started glitching out & been taking forever to do simple things on my phone altogether (not only within the app). I disabled the notification bar & my phone started working normally again. Too bad cuz I liked seeing my progress in my notification bar.,2
LG Health,"I used the app before and I loved it. Keep my all my daily progress... time, step, percentage and location. But, now is not as efficient as before. Some days doesn't work at all. Could it be because I'm using a Samsung phone instead of lg? Please let me know.",2
LG Health,"If anyone wants to know how to get rid of the new update, which is hella stupid. Go into your settings > apps > LG Health. Disable the app, and enbaled it again. What it does it resets the app to the factory setttings, when you renabled it, it won't have any of the recent updates. If you dont want this problem to keep happening, go into the auto- updating apps, and swtich to manual update. Simple as that, your welcome.",2
LG Health,"I liked it till a few weeks ago. It stopped tracking my steps/activity accurately. Today I walked for an hour and a half, LG health only recorded 21 minutes. Battery was in the 90's from start to finish. I'm hoping a reinstall fixes it.",2
LG Health,"I disabled this app after the December 14th update. It was draining my battery and the ""always on"" notification was driving me crazy. I only used it for stair counting anyway, since my fitbit doesn't. Will just find another app that does the same thing.",1
LG Health,This app was all great until the last update for this. Please do change it in a way so that it doesn't keep automatically run and have that annoying notification bar that's not removable. It also keeps taking up my ram so I've had to uninstall all updates and turn off auto update on app store. please update,1
LG Health,"This app was working fine for at least 3 years until two days ago. I walk the same exact route with my dogs every morning and it suddenly is recording only about half of the approximately 8,000 steps. Please fix immediately.",1
LG Health,Hate the constant icon in Notification Bar. It's terrible and I would uninstall the app rather than have the permanent icon - except I can't even uninstall it! This latest update is a total disaster... why would anyone want the permanent notification icon. Please remove this ridiculous feature that has been forced upon us. Very disappointed LG user.,1
LG Health,"Permanent notification because of Google's Android policies? I don't think so! Someone's reading it wrong. I should at least be able to set the priority to minimum so it doesn't appear in the task bar. The app is of background interest for me anyway, but with this I'm disabling it.",1
LG Health,"Works Super easy super Great on my LG G6 Thanks a lot LG for this app , i'm using this app since i had the LG G2 (2013) than the V10 (2015) and now the G6 (2017)... It helped me so much during my activities and workout it gives you a lot of information in real time and after the activity ... I really hope more improuvments in the near futur for this app ... Huge shout out for the developers ...Peace ✌",4
LG Health,"all the info u asked for, is in ny comment... useless so far... counts steps as it likes... sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt... set 10.000 steps as a goal - app counted 57 - after a 3 hrs walk... next day it stopped at 5 steps... today its at 12 steps - after a 5km morning run... reset and set it up again several times - same result... other apps i use for workout work perfectly, so my phones sensors are fine... lg g8x thinq - android 9 v10e...",1
LG Health,"This app is Highly Questionable as well as my LG Account App that is installed as a system App from ""Source Unknown"". Ive selected my lg account to sync to however Sync has been ""Disabled By System Administrator""? Who the Heck is running Google? 8/12 LG has NO Clue who or how these apps are being developed by. The links provided by email go to an http site NOT https. LG from a computer is OEM LG and this LGE is ... ? I dont Trust it. Not the same as my Old LG from 4 years ago. Total Failure",1
LG Health,"Does ok if your phone is on your body at all times. My phone is not on my body at all times, so an app like this is ok. Will say I haven't been active for 2 hrs, when I have! But is good at tracking steps when phone is on me. Phones are so big, need to engineer women's pockets to be larger....",2
LG Health,"I don't want this running in the background, i have my Garmin I use when I want to track my activity. Please remove the availability for it to be in the background. I've also uninstalled updates to stop it but keeps updating as well. thank you",1
LG Health,"Was good until the last update, but now the step counter is WAY out. It says I've done over 40000 steps on a day when it would've been around 10000. The funny thing is 20000 of those steps were at the dinner table, I sat on my arse, ate my dinner and, done 20000 steps and 15kms. Uninstalling and back to the original version.",1
LG Health,Anytime the phone is restarted the app freezes and doesn't log anymore activity,2
LG Health,"It is a good app but wish they would put in the option for hiking/backpacking to add what weight you're carrying because that makes a big difference. I would also like to see other everyday activities people do, like mowing and chopping wood, I mean there is paragliding come on.",3
LG Health,"It kept track of my steps and showed distance and time but it did not add it in to the statistics for the day. Then, when I tried to add -it doubled. If I did it wrong,then it's not user friendly. But it did what I needed initially.",3
LG Health,"I switched to Android from Apple, and I have to say I enjoyed the Apple Health app immensely more than LG Health. I wish there were better options for viewing graphs of activities over past segments of time. The Apple Health app also encompassed more then the LG Health app does. I haven't found a suitable replacement yet.",4
LG Health,"I walked on my treadmill for 4.5 miles and the app denies it. Says i only walked 2.5 the entire day! How discouraging. It does NOT count all my steps. If there is a trick to get it to work, I'm clueless. Also, if i weighed as little as the app says I should, I'd look sick.",1
LG Health,"cool app, just think you guys can make it more interactive.. for instance if i want to run a 5km run i can enter 5km distance it sets aproximatly 5km ruite for me (what would make it more cool is if it calculates the sealevel of the streets for incline and decline so you cam chose a more intense/chilled route) *could you make it sinc with a music app so it picks up the pace you running at and selects songs acording to your pace!? Come on i thought LG was more inovative",3
LG Health,I'm like the Samsung health app this app does not record that I've seen steps at a healthy and prolonged pace does not separate normal steps from healthy Pace steps,1
LG Health,its a good app i like it use a lot during I exercising. Its not counting and marking the steps that I make while using the app. Normally when I exercise I do 20 mins walking and 10 mins of walking up and down the stiars. Now when I check the results for the day its not even close of half of what I normally do. Last time it was working right was two days ago. Thats the 12th of this month.,4
LG Health,"Does not seem to be any way to turn background tracking off so it drains precious battery power. I just want to use it for manual tracking of runs etc. Also not clear why it needs access to contacts, and to send SMS messages.",2
LG Health,Doesn't work at all on my LG V60. Can't remove it or reinstall it. Piece of junk app.,1
LG Health,"I love the reminders to drink water, and the walking tracker. However, for the cycling, It uses the gps, and won't work for a stationary bike, since that doesn't go down the street. Would be better if it did.",4
LG Health,"i love this app, i really do but the milage calculaor is off by 1/2 mile per mile. so if i really walk a mile the app says its 1 1/2 miles. Once in a while if the signal gets lost the tracker falls off line and it starts over. aside from those things the app is decent and i enjoy it, i wish i could count on it more but i cant.",3
LG Health,Used to be good. Doesn't track well anymore. Loses connection. Becoming useless.,1
LG Health,"I was able to roll back the recent update in Google play to turn off the always on notification. Get rid of that feature! I don't want it in my notification bar, and am definitely going to uninstall the silly app at some point.",2
LG Health,I like app... but it dont update information immediately. Have to reboot phone sometime to see update. Sometime have to input information twice to take. Water tracker does the same. Also water tracker show updated then next day show zero water drank... Also why cant you manually update stuff the next day? Cant fix the app tracker mistakes.,1
LG Health,"I used to like this app, it seemed reliable. However, today I walked a round of golf. This is usually 15,000 steps. Today, it reported 52,000. That's just crazy. LG, fix your app it pull it",1
LG Health,"When I'm not very active in the morning it says ""You've walked over less than usually. Try to walk more in the afternoon."" The improper first sentence was endearing at first but it's gotten annoying. Please fix.",3
LG Health,Easy to use. Help me burn calories and achieve my goals. Love it,4
LG Health,"I liked it on my LG G5, when we upgraded phones, we went with Motorola (sorry LG, better deal). We wanted to transfer our historical data from old phones to new, but I could jot find a way to do that. I even created an accout to login, but it still did transfer.",3
LG Health,"This app has an incredible battery draw, which is awful since it's a decent app. LG app on an LG phone and I have to disable it so I dont suck my battery all day. Pity. UPDATE 2020: Still a battery drainer. No better after updates since Spring of 2019. I would love to use it, but it's not worth the drain on the device.",1
LG Health,"I am 71 and with NORMAL walking, LG Health has me taking 4849 steps in 44 min. and 31 seconds even though the average female does barely more than that for a whole day, even discounting age. And LG Health has me taking 2821 steps in 27 minutes and 7 seconds. That averages out to a 104 steps a minute for a 71 year old with normal walking even though the average BRISK pace is 100 steps. Your app does nothing to gauge the length of each step. LG help has major problems with the accuracy of its app.",2
LG Health,"Is there a glitch here? My water intake log is not saving for the past week. Sent an email 2 days ago but have not heard anything back! I like this app but if its not doing what it should, then I have no need for it anymore.",3
LG Health,"Not worth it; tracking, when walking, is inconsistent. I'm recovering from knee surgery and trying to keep track of my walking. Today it shows I walked 69 steps when it was, in fact, just over 400.",1
LG Health,"Hate this new ""always on"" notification. Going to have to disable the app and find a new one. I didn't mind it as a background thing, but I do not need your inaccurate step counts in my notifications bar at all times.",1
LG Health,Not at all accurate after last update. Some days there is no recording of my activity at all and I carry it where I always have. I have an LG phone...app came with it...just is not at all reliable.,1
LG Health,"Would like to be able to enter exercise times for previous days, and perhaps also to pre-enter scheduled exercise activities (maybe send a notification reminder to confirm). Also should include other physical activities like gardening, snow shoveling, mowing lawns, etc.
",3
LG Health,"Why do i not experience the battery drain everyone talks aboyt? This is a great app! Icon in the notification bar is a down, but that shouldn't bother you if you are using the app for it's real purpose!",4
LG Health,"recently my android system has been notifying me ""LG Health is using battery"" tap for details. It has been since an update that has recently been made. I have to force stop in order for the symbol on my notification bar to go away.",1
LG Health,I enjoyed this app until the constant notification. I disabled the notification and now it says the app is using a lot of battery constantly. I cannot get rid of that notification either. Im deleting the app and getting another fitness tracker.,1
LG Health,I had this app on my old phone. It's not accurate with your steps or anything you do physically. I took it off. Now this app came with my phone & I immediately took it off then it popped back onto my phone. Annoying. ✋,1
LG Health,If i could put a half star that is what I would rate this the track does not track your running if your screen turns off. It does not track laps if you run around a track or around your city block. The tracker is not accurate it says I was running trough other people houses when it is physically impossible it is a nice app but not a good tracker.,1
LG Health,Worthless on an LG phone (5 phones in a month across both the g7 and g8 with nothing but errors and incorrect exercise data) even worse when added to a competitor's much better device. YMMV but I'll never use another lg smart phone or smart phone app.,1
LG Health,The app doesn't allow / give an option to connect my LG Watch Urban LTE. This is really annoying.,2
LG Health,"After the most recent update, this app seems to be logging steps at least as accurately as it did before the prior update. LG was actually pretty quick in fixing the issue. This app does make it easy to track basic activities with minimal battery usage.",4
LG Health,"So, any time I leave flat to go somewhere (by bicycle as usual) I have to tell app that I'm waking down the stairway and once I'm out of the building tell app again that I'm going to be riding a bicycle. After I arrive at destination I have to repeat viceversa steps while taking bicycle to place B and once again when leaving place B and going home... Ty LG...",1
LG Health,hbwst health app out there even use it on ky main devices which are almost all sll htc wlth a few couple samsung and a n essential ohone. buggest complaint and hence 4/5 🌟s- ias once a day ends you can't go back and edit the app was just really frustrating if your phone's dead and you have to leave it at home while you go do some kind of vigorous exercise then the day ends and you can't put it into your phone and have to finagle it into the current day to get a similar step count. very annoying,4
LG Health,ADD AN OPTION TO REMOVE THE ALWAYS-ON NOTIFICATION. I loved the reminder notifications but had to disable notifications for this app because of this recent update. I'll end up using another fitness app and disabling this one if you don't fix it.,1
LG Health,"Not impressed with this app. Not sure why, but the app will delete info you're trying to track in the challenges section. So while you can track data about yourself, the app may decide to erase that data, making the app useless. Would not recommend.",2
LG Health,"App si great! What happend with LG fitness? Why is not in the store?, I downloaded it from somewhere and it is working only for couple of hours... I bought LG lifeband and I can't use in it's full potencial if the app LG fitness not working and LG health can't connect with the lifeband",5
LG Health,"I love this app because it's very specific to you and your workout, or daily activity, which is important. But I just wish it was compatible with Pokémon Go so I could get credit for the 12000 steps I took the other day. Totally would've hatched that dumb egg.",4
LG Health,"was so happy with this app but suddenly it won't count any of my steps anymore and it's really frustrating. i tried fixing it, i checked permissions, updated the app, turned my phone on and off, disabled and reenabled the app, nothing works :/ sad!",1
LG Health,"Doesnt pick up on activities correctly. When walking, if you start and stop in the same place (so like around the neighborhood or on a circle track) the distance is zero. I would think this would be an obvious fix.",1
LG Health,This app works when it wants to. Just had to remove everything from the app by deleting all of my hard work. Same problem anyway. Only works when it wants to. Not when I'm ready everyday. Sad for a health app,1
LG Health,"While this is a nice attempt on a pedometer, it falls very short on options. There is no way to adjust the sensitivity so it either NEVER starts counting or is way under/over. The layout needs work, too much fluff. Just use ANY other app.",2
LG Health,"I guess I walked 300 miles today! After getting home from work I had walked about 15 miles. Well, to my surprise after a good nap that 15 went all the way up to 300. This is not the first time that has happened. I understand this app isn't 100 percent accurate but to be that off multiple times is absurd.",2
LG Health,Have been recording my steps since 2017 on my LG G6 with this app. Since the last update i'm now getting very inacturate results. At least 80%+ each day compared to the last version. Such a shame.,1
LG Health,Had to disable. Keeps drawing over other apps to tell me something about OAuth and that there was an error. It worked great until a week ago. I've tried everything and can't get it to stop misbehaving.,1
LG Health,Ive tried different apps and have found this one to be the best. Works very well on the LG G8. Love the flexibility and options this app provides over others. Love that it adds my workouts onto step counts to give cumulative fitness data. Variety of data display options as well.,5
LG Health,Has been displaying double the amount I walk. Checked against a map. Shows me as running when I am just walking. Adds steps while I am sitting down having a meal. I live and walk around an area that is absolutely flat but app adds stair climbing. Wish I could delete app.,1
LG Health,Wish i could uninstall. Sick and tired of apps and whatever preloaded onto phones. Or apps that need lots of permissions and you dont really know what those apps are doing or why you have to have them.,1
LG Health,"Works well and seems to be accurate. A little tricky to get used to the lay out and what is where. There are icons without lables, making it a hieroglyphic to decipher.",3
LG Health,"I've loved this app but the newest update killed it. it's always crashing, doesn't record properly, and is always on the notification bar. annoying 😒 I've gone back to basic til it's fixed.",1
LG Health,"Jugdy app. I have fibromyalgia and getting mobile everyday is hard, plus being full-time student. Tells me to take walk or get moving during class time. Wish there was an app that supports health monitoring for people with chronic illnesses.",2
LG Health,"I used to love this app and would use it daily to compete with my husband. Since the update it's been counting steps on its own, i saw that i had 90,500+ steps so sure i beat him but its definately not accurate at all.",1
LG Health,"I do NOT want this app running all the time and using battery. After the last update, this has become a problem. I use a different fitness tracker. For me, this app is useless since I do not always carry my phone. How do I stop it??",1
LG Health,"The app is pretty good, the only complaint I have is the lack of notification when the tracker is running. I repeatedly forget to stop it when I'm done cycling :(",3
LG Health,This app is much inferior to the LG health app I had previously on the same LG 3G phone. It's frustrating as it's supposed to be an upgrade. I want the old one back!,2
LG Health,"Would have given a 4 or 5 til last update. Since then is crazy. Did short ""poop"" walk with dog first thing this morning. Maybe half to 1 mile, then a 5 mile walk with group, then a 2 mile walk with dog. After the 5 mile walk, about 50 minutes, it said i walked 20 minutes and gave no amount of steps. Just showed daily goal. Got back from 2 mile walk anow says i have walked 25000 steps and 12.9 miles! Have LG V40 Thin with doftware update on 10/2 with android version 9, kernel 4.9.112, v405ua20g.",1
LG Health,"Was great when I got my phone. Since it updated it no longer keeps track of my daily stair climbing 😞. It does however keep great track of my weight, water drinking and steps/miles walked each day😊.",4
LG Health,"i dont use this, but it insists on using battery and im constantly being notified about it. it also wont let me update the info in it, even though i have moved 3 times and now live in a different time zone.",1
LG Health,"It drains battery and is always on the notification bar, unless you shut off all notifications for it. And I can't delete it off MY phone. This update created more problems than it fixed.",1
LG Health,"I appreciate having the app, but the recommended weight is a joke. There should be a body type option included. The last time I was the recommended weight according to my height I was extremely ill. Beyond the bmi, it's a nice app.",3
LG Health,"Few days ago counting is different, shows more than it should. Sometimes counting when I'm doing nothing. Something happened, hopefully it's the app, not the phone. LG G7 thinq European version",2
LG Health,"The last few times I have used this it has failed to commect. Did a 3 hour ride today and when I got back home the app still said ""searching for signal."" Any suggestions?",1
LG Health,Use this all the time when I run. Came with my phone (LG) but I know it also works on Samsung S10 & Note phones and the Nokia 3.1 (I've tested it on those 3). The Samsung phones come with a similar app.,4
LG Health,"I hate this app. I just wanted to see what this app was and it set a goal foe a lot of steps and that was stuck in my notifications tab and was using battery. I wanted to remove the goal but I couldent, I tried to set the goal to 0 but it wouldent let me save it. I had to force stop the app. LG, Fix your mistake.",1
LG Health,Awful since Sept 2019 update!! It counts steps when the bus is moving but I'm just sitting in it! It used to work but it now shows that I do 60k or 70k steps a day!!! That's just crazy!! (Edit: your response is lame and non-sensical),1
LG Health,Does not keep accurate track of my running. Several times has logged it as walking.,1
LG Health,"Like the other recent posters, my steps have gone crazy since I updated. Trying to hit my goal of 7k steps (I work a desk so its hard) and all of a sudden I'm hitting 130-180% even if I don't work out. Today at 12k steps before lunch which is impossible. Update the app to fix this and I'll come back and re-review. LG X Venture, android 8.1.0. Edit: im back. It got fixed at some point. But was lower than fitness tracker. Then this month finally working. For a week. Now its too low again",3
LG Health,"This app used to work fine. Latest update forces a notification to be up forever unless you disable it, a feature 0 people want, and it drains battery life so much LG's own battery life app warns you to disable it.",1
LG Health,"Another perfectly fine working app now ruined by LG. What a great decision to have a permanent notification, because I can't remove the app, I've now uninstalled all updates and disabled, will just use Google now.",1
LG Health,"I found this app easy to use, helped me to keep on track with my health. However it recently stopped countung anything I did all together! the notification bar stopped at around 1236 steps, and in the app it said I had not walked any steps at all!",3
LG Health,Having a hard time figuring this one out. It doesn't seem to track the same activicty on both screens. AND I have to open the open the app amd LEAVE IT OPEN or it won't track activity at all.,3
LG Health,"The tracker was working until it recently stopped. I mean it only displays duration correctly, but all other facts like elevation, distance, etc are constant ZERO. Please LG, you should do better than this.",1
LG Health,That works well except when you want to minimize it. Most of the time when you go to minimize it at stops the current tracking and you have to start all over again. Extremely frustrating.,3
LG Health,"I give 3 stars, based on the fact you cannot add your workout history from the day before. Many times I forget to add workouts and would love to add missed workouts. App would get 5 stars if a date was added so you can add missed workouts.",3
LG Health,"The app is better today; however, it is now shaving 5 seconds off each minute, costing me steps...HELP!!!",3
LG Health,I find no words to express or explain my satisfaction over using this app. It is a wonderful and useful app.,5
LG Health,Not a bad app. Like the tracker for cycling. Should include an input for stride length to maybe be a bit more accurate for counting steps. All round a great app.,4
LG Health,"How to stop to counting steps , means after completing the setted goal , it works after that and counting the steps, so how to stop.",4
LG Health,"This app doesn't follow my steps, fits at 217 steps and still doesn't count steps...😡😡😡 LG Q7 Android version 9",1
LG Health,"I love this app and will give it 5 stars as soon as this problem is fixed: suddenly this app is 'using too much battery and data,' and it only started after a recent update.",2
LG Health,"Was able to delete the icon from notification bar via Settings, Apps & Notifications -- even though LG warned not to. Now getting msg from Norton saying its using a lot of the battery. How about a rollback? Uness you really like negative reviews.",1
LG Health,The last few days the app has not been tracking my steps and I track my water intake daily but the next day I look back and the app deleted my water logs to look as if I didn't drink or track anything... Not happy..,3
LG Health,Not very useful to me because I can't enter information from my workouts manually and the information provided by the app such as calories burned is not reflective of the numbers I'm seeing at the gym.,2
LG Health,"I would give it a zero rating. Folks producing this app are hard to reach and if you don't cancel the free trial, they will take your money! Worst of all, LG Health is UK. At least I believe they are since I'm getting international fees on my debit card. Stay away from these guys!",1
LG Health,"It is difficult to completely close this app. I keep getting updates on the ""daily steps"" that I have taken. This is info that I no longer want or need.",2
LG Health,"I don't enjoy that the app now runs in the Task Manager/ notification bar. but I would LOVE if LG Added more options to the Health app like a way to track meals, track sleeping, calorie counter. PLEASE ADD MORE TO THIS APP. IT COULD BE A GREAT APP",2
LG Health,"last update is stupid. Turn off notifications to get it back to last version and instead of have notification you get bugged about the app using your battery. so the disable feature is a waste. if not fixed, or returned to last version, will uninstall the app.",1
LG Health,"The app was nice till the last update. it shows constantly the notification. if i completely disable the app's notifications it shows another that ""LG health is using battery"". why LG has rolled out an untested update?? Fix please!",1
LG Health,The app is good but after every major android update it is stop working properly. For instance after the update to android 9.0 I'm walking more than 10km per day and the phone is in my pocket all the time but the app is showing 0.00 km,3
LG Health,i use it all the time. i really love it but lately it is dropping previous days water tracking. still wondering when this will be fix.. now the app i s locking up for 2 to 3 minutes at a time.😖,1
LG Health,Latest update makes a banner stay on your screen and you can't get rid if it. Android System says it's constantly draining battery. Used to be a good app.,1
LG Health,"the app is good, but I was walking this morning and it lost a lot of steps!!! almost 2 km lost! I kept the phone with the screen ON to listen to YouTube songs!!!!",3
LG Health,"I will change and add one star because the advanced setting does allow you to pick the workout. However, adding yoga and more activity types to the Challenge section would be phenomenal.",4
LG Health,It would be a great app if it worked. The pedometer isnt even close to actual steps. It counts steps when Im driving. Ridiculous....,2
LG Health,Since the upgrade the fitness tracker is not accurate. I have not figured out the difference bit it is almost 2-3x more tjan mu true steps. LG G7 ThinQ phone LG phone with Verizon The fitness tracker isn't accurate,1
LG Health,"I like the app notifications but I don't want the sound. I can't find the option to mute them, does it exist?",1
LG Health,Good basic tool. Needs to be able to fix errors made in the past information. Needs also the ability to calculate stride length for more accurate step count,3
LG Health,Non intrusive... Not too bad on battery. Accuracy seems to vary greatly over a set course (accessing different satellites?) Over all better than a lot of others ive tried.,3
LG Health,"The app. Works periodically, which means it's not accurate. I go 5 miles and the thing register s 739 steps. I'm looking for a new one.",4
LG Health,latest update has added permanent notification and made it a battery eater: disabling this thing LIVE! LG should know better. Biggest battery usage working on the background supposedly? I don't think so!,1
LG Health,"This app is trying to tell me the ideal weight for someone who is 5 feet 7 inches is 134 pounds its kind of bullsh*t I have always been 150 pounds with a good amount of muscle. It kind of worries me with all of those young impressionable girls out there that are probably using this app. There's going to be a lot of sickly looking sticks walking around out there with a lot of health problems with this unrealistic ""perfect"" or ""ideal"" weight that this app says people should be",1
LG Health,App is OK but I would like to start and stop it than it just running all the time I tried setting a time but since it was running wouldn't let me set a time to start so I had to disable app until I figure it out,1
LG Health,"i used to like this app when it just updated a couple times a day. Now you can't hide the app, it is constantly on. Uninstalling what used to be useful and now is annoying.",3
LG Health,"My doctor diagrees with the recommended weight - it is too low. I would be ill if I reached it. Using BMI alone, and not considering physique and distinguising muscle from fat has been recognised as a flawed concept for a long time.",1
LG Health,"I have really enjoyed this app. I have tracked several routes that I walk and it's been a great tool for measuring distance, time traveled and how long it takes to complete the walk.",2
LG Health,"You have to have the phone in your pockets 100% of the time for it to work, I went walking for over 2 hours and it registered 8 mins so besides tracking how much water I drank it's pretty useless",1
LG Health,"It keeps prompting me now to log I to my LG account and sync it together but when I do that, it's not registering. Was working great until the most recent update.",1
LG Health,"Misses like 1 out of every 5 walk/runs/hikes. I don't see any pattern to when it fails to work, but it kind of defeats the purpose of the app.",2
LG Health,worked great for a little while loved it told me how fast how far I was going everything then all the sudden it just died I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it three times well as everybody knows three strikes you're out,1
LG Health,"This app drains the battery! No way to stop it without getting messages ""disabling will cause other phone functions to not work properly"". It only keeps up with steps. Much better options out there.",1
LG Health,It has been a accurate app but lately the app says that I am 50 miles plus in a day and I know that is not true! Must be the app up date that has it screwed up!!,4
LG Health,All the exercise type recorder in one app that you can record exercise type and track them also you can check your BMI and the suggestion weight.im realy enjoy to using this app but this app needs more option like record water drinking sleep tracker or etc.thank you LG for this great app.,4
LG Health,"Since the update it is really messing up,my step count. According to,the app i am still walking while it is in the charger. Used to love it",1
LG Health,"Water reminder no longer works. I apologize that I forgot to edit my review. I messed around with it, and now its working. Thank you for responding.",4
LG Health,Installed Samsang health and LG health on my LG G7 . But LG health is giving wrong counting of steps and totally in acurate measurement of Distance and Cal calculation. While Samsong health work properly and very acurate.,1
LG Health,It's been great up to the latest update. I don't want a permanently featured notification. Uninstalled and disabled for auto-updating.,1
LG Health,"I like using this app, but it does not record my run accurately even though I use the time when I go for a run.",3
LG Health,overall a pretty good app. ive been using it for a while and love that i can have a widget. however it does track steps when I'm not moving recently,4
LG Health,"Worked great til the latest update. No longer supports bicycling or stairs. Uh, OK. Why? Now it's useless for me.",2
LG Health,Absolutely love being able to see how many miles a day I actually walk without even knowing it... love how it tells me when I am more active and not,4
LG Health,I would've given a higher rating but ever since the last update it doesn't always count my steps and some times I get a message(usually 2-3 times) pop up that the app isn't responding.,1
LG Health,"Well-designed app, if it would auto track cycling like Google Fit (or at least pull that data when connected) it would be useful for me, disabling until then",3
LG Health,App is horrible. Doesn't track anything unless it is constantly running and then you keep getting notifications that the app is running in the background.,1
LG Health,"The app is okay, but the ""nag"" notifications are awful! There IS NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF????????? The blogger say the only way is to uninstall the app, IF LG allows it.",1
LG Health,it dont work....in the next update you need to disable auto update smh....it auto updates even though i have auto update turned off in play store....i walked 2 miles and the app only claims 1 mile smh,1
LG Health,Would like it better if it had health tips or easy exercise and eating. Ado to be able to transfer app to external SD memory card. Instead of using up internal phone memory.,3
LG Health,"Feature removed, why?(Activity recognition of cycling and climbing stairs are no longer supported.). This is nice feature please add it.",1
LG Health,The tracking feature when you start and stop your runs doesnt work for me ever. It just marks my start and end point not my distance ran between start and stop.,3
LG Health,"Cool concept, doesn't work. Steps counted when I move my phone, but not when I'm actually walking.",2
LG Health,"It was accurate for a while but now, it's a hit or miss. It skips some days and some hours of activity. I have just uninstalled and reinstalled it. We'll see what happens from this point on.",4
LG Health,Easy to use but only track a fraction of my walks. No point using it,2
LG Health,"At first it worked pretty well, now the latest information it has is from April 14th. That was a month ago. I cannot figure out how to get it to show current information.",1
LG Health,why am i forced to have this in my notifications ALL THE TIME?? I tried uninstalling updates because of this and it deleted all my fitness history and all data. I AM FURIOUS. FIX THIS. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS TO ALWAYS BE THERE. It was fine as it was. Why do constant updates always ruin things that were fine to begin with?,1
LG Health,"Very basic. No account creation (which is a plus depending on how you look at it), be sure to sync with Google Fit.",4
LG Health,"I did like it, but with the new version of Oreo it is always in my notification bar and its driving me nuts. Let ME choose what I always see. I'm turning this app off.",1
LG Health,"The app.works well. Whenever you walk, run , jog, etc. it monitors how far you've gone .Miles etc. I highly reccomend this app.",4
LG Health,"Since the last update its Automatically Match mode is not working on my LG V10, its no more recongonizing my exercise pattern, i do running,cycling or walk it always show walking.",2
LG Health,"great application , but it does not sync well between devices. works well for a single device.",2
LG Health,"It was useful but now it's annoying. A constant notification is unnecessary, and if I turn it off my phone keeps telling me the app is draining the battery.",1
LG Health,"I never use it, but it is always crashing. disabling the damn thing doesn't help either, it just cut cell data out instead. Gotta love this delicious unkillable bloatware.",1
LG Health,"i had LG flex 2 before, and he trace my steps automaticly... in this LG K9 2018 i have to set up and make start in app to trace my steps. Every time i forgot to start app tracing i will miss my walking goal",3
LG Health,"The new constant notification is incredibly annoying, and now the app is draining battery constantly. Terrible update. Can't even uninstall it.",1
LG Health,Only has limited options. Good thing is it remind to drink water. But step counter is awfully bad. It count steps even when I'm sitting or travelling in any vehicle.,2
LG Health,"Love this app, simple to use. I sometimes wonder why it can't find my location when I hikebut I know where I am at.",4
LG Health,"I use this app already for 3 years. It was pre-installed on my LG G5 and I pulled this app to my new Xiaomi device. Everything works good. May you just to add more sport activities, like fencing (epee, foil and sabre) in the next release? Thanks!",4
LG Health,"I use this app already for 3 years. It was pre-installed on my LG G5 and I pulled this app to my new Xiaomi device. Everything works good. May you just to add more sport activities, like fencing (epee, foil and sabre) in the next release? Thanks!",1
LG Health,"It would be a nice addition to manually enter the speed of running or walking. Right now, manual time entry only is possible.",4
LG Health,This is consistently 25% less in terms of distance recorded than my Garmin watch. Even with a margin of error applied this app seems way off.,1
LG Health,"Since the update the step counter isn't accurate. Moving the phone causes it to register a step, even if I'm sitting down",3
LG Health,"Wildly inaccurate, but it does work for sort of figuring out you activity level. It's good for starting out in tracking fitness related things tho.",3
LG Health,Only tracks part of my walk. Walked 45 minutes it recorded 30! This on multiple days. Friend has same problem. Worthless!,1
LG Health,"It used to be good, but after the update there is always a notification and someother app says that LG Health is running in the background.",1
LG Health,"Inaccurate because I cannot carry phone all day, so notifications are useless and wrong. I don't care to be lectured from a device that is clueless. It's supposed to be a benefit to my day. It would be a waste of what little time I have to enter my activity every day into it. A phone is about communicating with people, not things. I especially dislike LG taking away the uninstall option. I should be allowed to set my phone to operate in a manner most useful to me, not to the way LG wants.",1
LG Health,"Doesn't automatically detect my steps even though it seems to be set up correctly, only detects my steps when held in my hand which doesn't work for me when I'm outdoors walking so uninstalling ...",1
LG Health,Great app for day to day tracking. I wish you could add activity's from previous days though as I tend to forget to add my evening workouts when i get home from the gym.,4
LG Health,I have enjoyed using this app for walking and recording distances/steps and being able to track the routes I have taken on foot or bicycle.,4
LG Health,"I used to love this app on my G7, but since the new always on notification I am disappointed...please add options for that notification or remove it completely...it's annoying, it used to work just fine! 😢",1
LG Health,App stops counting steps while using another app or function like calling / youtube. And again starts counting which tends to incorrect measurements of calorie burnt and distsnce covered.,3
LG Health,This is a cool app for keeping up with water intake and exercise however its doesn't calculate properly especially when it comes to steps and other activities,3
LG Health,"After the last update the app started counting steps, and it didnt stop even though i put my phone on a table, force restart didnt work. Currently at 120k steps, what a great day for my diet",1
LG Health,"Not even close on my steps, I know I've walked almost half a mile and it shows 212 steps, and I have short legs. Been wrong since I loaded it on my new phone. F'n garbage, uninstalled",1
LG Health,Doesn't work at all. Used this for 3 years and now it records no steps. Completely useless. Fix ASAP,1
LG Health,"Truly awesome app! Helped me drop 12 pounds just through fitness tracking! Took me few months to consistently average & surpass target steps, though.. Around 4 months.",5
LG Health,This app is very helpful.I remember how many times I went for a ride because I knew that it'll remain me that I didn't be active.,5
LG Health,"Basic app and it doesnt even work most the time. Just disappointed. I loved my samsung health app, it also did calorie counting. So maybe you should update app to be better and do more.",1
LG Health,I used this app as a step counter and now it doesnt count at all. Not a fan of the constant notification.,1
LG Health,uninstalled!!! It runs in the background at all times and you cannot remove the icon from the notification bar! I used to love this application but will not use it again until it is updated ao that the user has more control,1
LG Health,"I loved that it senses your moves even without manually having to switch it on, and tells you if you exercised more or less today",5
LG Health,good app but a pain since the last update on oreo.. to turn off the icon. go to app notifications. turn off the badge icon. turn rhe notifications & force close.,4
LG Health,"Samsung health lets you track your meals, caloric intake and heart rate and other things. This one just seems to track steps and weight.. Maybe im missing something here",3
LG Health,A simply wonderful app but please add dark mode and make it more modern,3
LG Health,The app has gone crazy. It mesures twice or thrice the steps that I do. Please fix it because previously it worked exellent.,3
LG Health,"worked fine on my old LG, and honestly I only used it becauss it was pre installed. Just installed on my new phone too.",5
LG Health,Last update made the app extremely inaccurate and also was a considerable power drain (23% power drain on an LG V30+). I had to force stop and disable.,1
LG Health,"Great app in general. But, it doesn't record properly when I'm on the treadmill.",4
LG Health,"Love it! Best app for monitoring daily, weekly, and monthly fitness that i have ever encountered. Highly recommend it!",5
LG Health,"app started great very accurate,all of a sudden app not working freezing up and unreliable so uninstalled it and and looking for another one",2
LG Health,Love this app! This is the only health app that I do use because it provides exactly what information I do need. Thank you LG!!,5
LG Health,Works if you are walking around but it has issues when you are on a treadmill.,2
LG Health,It keeps crashing in the background. I haven't opened the app in forever but I get at least 2 notifications a day informing me the app isn't responding. Uninstalled despite having a LGv20,1
LG Health,"Everytime I tried to use the location it would look like i was teleporting somewhere and get 3 times as many steps as i actually had gotten, also it drains my battery on my phone",1
LG Health,I don't want this app and I can't delete it this is very annoying. It keeps wanting me to update and I can't stop this. I should be able to choose what I want and not be forced to have it with constant notices to update this app I don't want or will ever use please help me permenatly erase this app!,1
LG Health,This app is the best i use it every single day and in my opinon its better than all the other fitness apps thanks lg you guys made a excellent app for lg users keep doing great. It is free and many amazing reviews should be seen.,5
LG Health,I like the app but when I ride my motorcycle it counts steps. Not cool. Can't find a way to stop or pause it.,4
LG Health,"kinda regret buying an LG phone because I can't uninstall this. this permanent notification is because of Oreo? when my G7 came with Oreo months ago? sure. I only use this for is syncing to Pokémon Go because I can't uninstall it to replace with Google Fit, which is apparently screwed now too. so I get even less of my notification area or risk the app ""not working properly""... also there's 2 permanent alerts now. one is a system alert about battery usage 🙄",1
LG Health,The app is good to provide quick stats on activity. I wish the developer team would have added a feature to disable the sound but still allow the visual notification.,3
LG Health,"Unable to sync with LG Server, getting a Google 403 Error, disallowed_useragent: Google can't sign you in safely inside the app.",2
LG Health,This is the WORST that this app has been in the 3.5 years since I've been using it (LG V10 and LG V30+). Just keeps crashing when trying to start workouts!,1
LG Health,Not what it once was. For some reason it no longers switches from walking to biking like once did before last Andriod update.,3
LG Health,New phone and google never works with it. Have to go get a new phone.,2
LG Health,Time was resetting automatically at 00.00hrs. The resetting time should be manually. That option should be required for most usefull.,4
LG Health,This has become awful with the constant notification on. I don't want this app at all anymore. Fix the problem!!!!!!!,1
LG Health,"Cannot recognize if i drive a bicycle, if i do not explicitly set exercize type. The same app on my previous G3 was recognizing walking, running and cycling, this one on V30 does not.",4
LG Health,"Latest update is much more inaccurate, it counts almost double steps for every step made. Fix it ASAP and I'll rerate app :)",2
LG Health,Used to work quite well until following a recent update it has become wildly inaccurate often doubling the step count. Uninstalled.,1
LG Health,Could not get it to track my biking...could not figure it out. Too frustrating....uninstalling.,1
LG Health,This worked for a few months and after that either it doesn't register the steps or does it erratically.,2
LG Health,"Add normal stuff like splitting wood, yard work. Add in factors like heat and humidity.",2
LG Health,"Loved this app when it worked. Since update to Pie, it won't track anything. Worthless.",1
LG Health,"Very unintuitive app, help is completely useless. For example I have no idea how to add a new weight measurement...",1
LG Health,On my old lg g6 it was very accurate and kept track of steps well but now after updating and using lg g8 it is very inaccute and the gps tracking is way WAY off.,3
LG Health,"Permanent notification since update is just too much. I've disabled the app completely, hopefully all the one star reviews will help fix it.",1
LG Health,"The app great however it was very inaccurate I work for 60 minutes and I had 27,000 steps please use better accelerometers and measurements.",2
LG Health,Tracking of steps is inaccurate. Steps are being recorded even when phone is not on the person.,1
LG Health,It constantly turns itself off. I have no idea how accurate it is because I keep having to turn it back on. It's annoying. I'm looking for a better app.,2
LG Health,It helps me gage how much more i need to walk! That is very helpful and encourages me.,4
LG Health,"I have been very happy with this app but recently it hasnt been counting my steps accurately, its shorting me steps",2
LG Health,This app just runs down your battery and is not even close to being accurate. Says i have walked 12 miles today and it has been pluged in in my truck most of day .,2
LG Health,I like this app because it help track my steps ever day.,5
LG Health,"Useless bloatware that I can't uninstall. +1 star for being disableable. That's what makes this a 2 star app. GOOD JOB, LG 🤗",2
LG Health,Absolutely the best fitness tracking app out there! Flawless! Impressed! And thank You!,5
LG Health,Dear LG! Thank you for placing a permanent icon on my phone's notification bar after recent update. I want to be in control on what is displayed on my phone! Disappointed.,1
LG Health,Good basic health app but now causing battery usage alert in Android Oreo for no apparent reason so probably needs another update. Constant notification was annoying too so disabled it.,3
LG Health,Was a great app till the last update. Now it rarely records my steps and just stops responding even when I'm not using it.,2
LG Health,"I keep getting error from this app, keeps popping up on my phone.... FINALLY FIXED THE PROBLEM!!!! TY!!!",3
LG Health,"app worked fine until most recent update. now it isnt working, at all.",1
LG Health,I walk 6 blocks and this app says that I've taken 11 steps. Flawed and useless app that can't be turned off as I'm on an LG phone. :-/,1
LG Health,App would often fail to record my steps. Was disappointed and frustrated with this App.,1
LG Health,decent app for free but doesn't keep track of water logs beyond the same day. Also running vs walking seems to get confused a lot.,3
LG Health,this app was working for me up until just recently when it quit updating my exercise information into Google Fit. now I can't stand this app 1 bit. please fix the app LG!,3
LG Health,This used to be a good app on a great phone. Last update ruined the app and significantly degraded my LG phone. ARE YOU LISTENING LG?!,1
LG Health,why is there a permanent notifications now?? when i try to hide it. i get another one telling me its running in the background. used to be great because of how discret it was.,1
LG Health,Excellent app to daily message for my fesicale exercise.,2
LG Health,It is the best app. It records my movement and the heary rate.,5
LG Health,This came with the device as bloatware and I would rather it not be there. As the app can not perform the one function I need from it. 1 Star.,1
LG Health,"The app keeps losing activities that I have just saved, and I have to enter them again after 10 minutes",3
LG Health,"Love this app, but can you add an arc trainer to list of activities?",5
LG Health,"Not very accurate, only picks up about 1-2 in every four or five steps that I take.",3
LG Health,"Seems to auto detect walking just fine, but can't auto detect cycling to save its life.",2
LG Health,Battery hog and not very feature rich. Meanwhile Samsung's Health app is leaps and bounds ahead of this.,3
LG Health,Too less features. Have issues in tracking workouts. Doesn't sync with Google Fit,2
LG Health,I really like this app so when I went to a Samsung phone I downloaded this app to use but I'm disappointed that you took away the stair climbing exercise.,4
LG Health,Why does the update require access to SMS. None of the changes seem like that would be necessary. I don't trust this app I wish I could uninstall.,2
LG Health,Works fine for me. Accurate step counts for hiking and walking.,4
LG Health,This is not an accurate app. It doesnt alway record when i am walking. Or it will double my actual steps.,1
LG Health,"After walking 3 hrs, the app showed i only walked 1 1/2 hrs. Since update the app has not been accurate.",1
LG Health,Even after disabling every permission the app still runs in the background and sucking the battery life out of my G6. Do something about it.,1
LG Health,Not accurate / realistic for appropriate weight for height and age.,1
LG Health,I use it every day and keeps me on check with my steps.. like it very much.,5
LG Health,"Coming from a Samsung with heart monitor and blood oxygen sensor this is a joke. Now the latest update forces always on icon, I hate it",1
LG Health,Not super accurate but I got rid of it because it has the stupid notification always on and im not getting rid of all other notifications so i'll stick with google fit its better anyways.,1
LG Health,"I dont like new update, bad enough this is the only app that i can use consistently with the phone. There is no need to take thee steps and climbing off of the app.",3
LG Health,I dont like this constent icon on my phone please guys why fix or improve something if it was working 100% before. Im gona disable this app for now untill its fixed!!!,1
LG Health,"Latest update shows a permanent notification and a battery warning, do you not use your own product? What kind of nonsense is this?",1
LG Health,Useless step tracker that is not accurate. The Fitbit does a much better job and gives more information.,1
LG Health,It does not work fine when you update it. having battery usage problem!,1
LG Health,Bad experience! The app keeps closing and does not track progress accurately.,1
LG Health,full of pop up ads. do not download. also won't uninstall!!!,1
LG Health,I love the way this app shows me how many steps calories and how many 8 oz glasses of water I drink.,5
LG Health,"The new update is horrible! It drains my battery quickly. I like this app, so please fix it.",1
LG Health,like it works and everything but it sure does drain the battery takes up all of the RAM...,3
LG Health,The widget just stopped working not sure what's going on but it's annoying.,1
LG Health,Since the android OS update...the log for steps NO LONGER works....please fix this!!,1
LG Health,love the monitoring of my steps and encouraging remarks to keep plugging along. lol😃🎈,5
LG Health,loved this until the new updated version requires the app to stay in your notification window. i do not like that so i am uninstalling it.,1
LG Health,Steps no longer show in notification bar and the setting to turn it back on is missing.,1
LG Health,Amazingly accurate and love how it works. Using it for my daily exercises.,5
LG Health,"Slightest movement of my phone, it tracks it: Picking my phone up, moving my phone, ect...",1
LG Health,Very poor at keeping track of anything happening fitness wise on a daily basis. disabled app and useing google fit as that works.,1
LG Health,awesome accurately matches with the smart watch. Also gives necessary recommendations regarding the weather. Always a fan of LG..,5
LG Health,The notification on the top always is annoying. Roll back and give us fresh updates.,3
LG Health,Used to be a good app. It won't even register my steps anymore. Uninstall,2
LG Health,Power walk challenge timing doesn't track properly,3
LG Health,Poor update....comes now with a permanent system battery usage warning....extremely annoying. Am disaling the app.,1
LG Health,"don't need/want it, it drains my phone battery. Hate the fact that in the last update, was pushed through with out my permission. I should be able to decide what I want on my personal phone, and not have to deal with a company's agenda.",1
LG Health,Very nice and simple to use app for tracking the activities,5
LG Health,"For those of you getting the constant notification pull status bar down, long press notification, and turn off.",5
LG Health,Better than Fitbit. Carry my phone always. No need to get just another device to keep track of steps.,5
LG Health,Why does this app need to read my contacts? That is suspicious Are you trying to steal my data? Google Play Protect clearly says that!,1
LG Health,Doesn't track accurately since last update- counts every 20 steps as 1. App shuts itself off every 2-3 days.,1
LG Health,It does not count or show the route you have walked. It also don't record your water oz.,3
LG Health,It can't calculate properly.Even can't recognise Cycling also.,1
LG Health,The app use to work. Now it won't register steps on my watch... Please fix th this...,1
LG Health,Used to work great but with the new end of December update.. It's not counting steps anymore....,2
LG Health,good app except it is always using my phone's battery. I want to be able to turn it off and on.,3
LG Health,Constant notification is annoying. I disabled the app until you fix it.,1
LG Health,New Year - New Permanent Notification (and constant battery drain) Went from my go to app to my disabled list. No thanks.,1
LG Health,Absolutely love this option... The app works great comparatively to other apps out there.,5
LG Health,"Not accurate and hence not useful at all, Very sloppy app. Should do the job well or LG should exit",2
LG Health,"Sometime it records my steps when walking, and other times it don't. What am I doing wrong?........",4
LG Health,i like how it encourage me whenever i walk a little bit more than usual. Oveeall a good app!,5
LG Health,"the app it's amazing. but wit the new recent update it's been a bit annoying about the notification stuff. like, i'd appretiate that at leats it'd be a silent notification.",4
LG Health,Love this free app! No spam. It just works,5
LG Health,The app was fine until it got updated to have a persistent notification. Now I will not use it.,1
LG Health,"Wildly inconsistent. Works fine sometimes, others not at all.",3
LG Health,Love the way you get reminders to drink water. My health has improved thanks to this app.,5
LG Health,what the heck no longer supported cycle tracking and all that,1
LG Health,"Doesn't keep recorded info. I've put in how much water i drank in one day. The next day, what i recorded is gone!",1
LG Health,Enjoyed reminders sometimes but I really don't appreciate something that is on at All times & producing a lot of dangerous EMF's etc!,4
LG Health,it just stopped working and it no longer works and is inaccurate.,1
LG Health,"Forced notification in statusbar.Why LG is forcing everyone to see the notification 24*7, there must be an option to enable pr disable the notification from notification panel as per our liking.",1
LG Health,Not accurate at all. Walked a distance and my steps were not recorded but phone was in hand,1
LG Health,"great app, could use a push mower setting because I am pretty sure I used more calories then it claimed",4
LG Health,When i am walking or bicycle riding it does't track accurately.,3
LG Health,"doesn't count the steps property , can't share your activity to people via Facebook or watapp I think the information is inaccurate that may lead to serious misinformation. please consider to update this apple and allow to count other activities properly without be forced to put hours and minutes",1
LG Health,This app is a glorified pedometer that rarely counts steps accurately. Boo!,1
LG Health,When I go walking I take my phone. I love the way the LG Health tracks my footsteps and lets me how many calories I have burned from my walk.,5
LG Health,An update installed this app on my phone without asking and LG health could not be turned off or muted.,1
LG Health,App is always stopping and closing. Widget has gone blank.,1
LG Health,"After i install the latest update, my V20 system tells, ""this app consuming too much battery""",3
LG Health,Very inaccurate when it works. Constantly sitting off due to failure,1
LG Health,Accuracy of the app during bicycling sessions is fantastic.,5
LG Health,"bloatware, always running, drains battery. never found it useful",1
LG Health,Great app. No commercials and it will also track me via GPS,3
LG Health,Update to fix cycle bugs. It doesn't pick up my bicycle activity.,3
LG Health,I used to enjoy this app until it became a permanent notification. I hate undismissable notifications and permanent left side tray icons.,1
LG Health,Bloatware plain n simple. Don't need nor want this. What bothers me are apps you have to give a star to. Or you can't leave a review!,1
LG Health,app has very limited abilities. cannot add exercises for past dates. no hr tracker. mostly useless,2
LG Health,it often doesn't count my steps and doesn't recognize it when i do stairs,2
LG Health,the GPS tracker is poor at best. even with HIGH ACCURACY is on.,3
LG Health,It would not show calories for yesterday or the day before. Google Fit does. I am using LG G6.,2
LG Health,Does not record steps any where near accurately.,1
LG Health,LG Health is a good App and i walk outside in our yard alot when iam outside!,5
LG Health,Apps currently broken steps will go up without doing anything accounting for battery drain,1
LG Health,It does not always count steps..phone can be in pocket and it will show nothing,3
LG Health,Best app to track your exercise & reminder to drink water.,5
LG Health,Need improvements alot while comparing with usual brands. User interface is not effective. Pathetic ways,2
LG Health,it use to be accurate but now its saying im riding my bike every time i drive my car!,2
LG Health,Have nothing good to say. Just annoyed at all ads,1
LG Health,Basic app. does not need to open(automatically track). does everything for me though,5
LG Health,"I sat on bed while it said i walked over 480 steps, what would it have said if i had walked? When i used to have this app several months ago it was great now updates terrible.",1
LG Health,bloatware that is constantly crashing in the background processes,1
LG Health,"Could you please fix issue with ""using battery"" after last update? Many thanks",2
LG Health,Does not even let me enter my own weight. It keeps resetting after I enter the third digit. LG phones are the worst. Never going for any lg products ever.,1
LG Health,"sends way too many updates to phone and will not disable that function, all dince after last msin uodate... deleteing this app.!!!",1
LG Health,Great me app for the lazy man's tracking because it really tells you.,4
LG Health,send every time i go to use this app it freezes up or won't open. time for something else,2
LG Health,Worked great but since the latest update it no longer works at all on my LG G7,1
LG Health,No longer counts any steps... I walk to worked this morning and still have 0 steps,1
LG Health,"Bloatware! We shouldn't be forced to have unwanted n unused apps on our devices! As much as the devices cost to buy, we should be able to decide what we do n do NOT want taking up space therein! Just a shameful policy, as is forcing us to give a star for the app in question just post a comment, smh!!",1
LG Health,doesnt accurately count and is always running/using battery in the background,3
LG Health,"This past week i continually get ""Force Close"" notifications for this app. I never even use it.",1
LG Health,does anyone know how to link it with a fitbit? its only accurate if you carry your phone at all times and i cant figure out how to make my fitbit the default app instead.,1
LG Health,very good app. it encourages you take more exercises,4
LG Health,accurate app 👍 it would be helpful to have the possibility of changing first day of the week in settings 🤫,5
LG Health,great app i lost 30 lbs because of this app thank you and im going to lose more!!!,5
Huawei Health,"Not really happy with this app, nor the GT2 pro watch I'm using with it - I get a lot of incorrect data that I cannot edit nor delete (e.g. when I watch TV, it tracks that I'm taking a nap, so it says that I've been sleeping 11-12 hrs a day), which makes it pretty useless for any tracking. I also cannot enter muscle % manually, and I'm not going to buy a new scale just to be able to track it.",2
Huawei Health,"I couldn't do firmware update, weather didn't work. The most important step when installing the Huawei Health application is not to start immediately, but to enter the airplane mode. When the application is launched, they will ask to choose a country, to choose countr, after that, when they go further, they will complain that there is no internet and the application will come out. Restart health and everything will work properly.",5
Huawei Health,"I cannot advance past the Service Region page. No matter what input, it does not advance to the next page. THE APP IS UNSUABLE WHICH THEN MAKES THE WATCH UNSUABLE. Currently using a S9 and Android 10. I tried everything from reinstalling, restarting phone, downloading from AppGallary, downloading HMS core, and updating softeware, yet nothing works.",1
Huawei Health,"Great application but perfectible. I started to use it with my Honor band 5 in early September and was tracking the heart rate and my sleeping data. I appreciated the expanded horizontal view for the heart rate but it is unfortunate that this option is not available for the sleep data. Also, it would be nice to be able to zoom on a specific day by using the month and the week views to end up on the wanted day. These different time views are now independent. This feature should be added.",3
Huawei Health,"Not the best app in the world, but still pretty good. Major issues are the fact the app sometimes doesn't open (It opens, but freezes and then eventually crashes and it can sometimes take several goes before it loads and works), and also when tracking 'Free exercise' on the watch (Honor Band 5), it doesn't show the stats in the 'Exercise' screen in the app. I like how the app looks and the stats it shows after a workout. However, it's not compatible with a majority of other apps.",3
Huawei Health,"great detail for all activities, sleep and monitoring. I have a problem with there not being an option to disable the phone pedometer when you have a wearable device, the steps conflict and uses unnecessary battery life on your phone. also needs to have your location on all the time to get weather information, which isn't the case with any other wearable and weather app",3
Huawei Health,"Good, but could be better. On the whole the app works well and syncs phone and Watch GT2. Improvements would be more customisable goals, and disabling the phone pedometer. Biggest gripe is that my date of birth keeps defaulting back to 1January 1990. I have not been 30 for a long time, and this has a dangerous effect on maximum heart rate when exercising. My DoB is correct in my profile, but it is a nuisance having to keep going to the profile and resetting the app regularly during the day.",4
Huawei Health,"Updating device list fails so my brand new band cannot be added. Also a big fat ZERO on privacy: requires both email and sms/phone number confirmation just for a simple health app. So my initial contact with a Huawei device: cheap copy-cat mess. It will be my last foray into ""affordable flagship like devices"" from Huawei, Honor and the bunch. EDIT: fixed by deleting huawei account, uninstalling app and returning band.",1
Huawei Health,"This app, phone and watch are absolutely rubbish. I've had the phone less than a year. The watch since March 2020. I have had to either the re-start the watch or power it off and back on again multiple times or uninstall and then re-install the app multiple times just get the watch to stay connected which then in turn re-sets all of the goals I am trying to achieve. I definitely would not recommend either to anyone else.",2
Huawei Health,You can't EXPORT GPS files! What?? WHY?! The most BASIC feature for a SPORT WATCH is unavailable! Unbelievable how such a large company could not include something so simple. Other than that it's a pretty good app. The 1* reflects how much of a necessity the ability to export as .gpx or similar is.,1
Huawei Health,"Impressive Sleep Recording! I downloaded this app after I got a Huawei Honor Band 5 off Amazon, and was instructed to manage the band via this app. The app allows for setting multiple alarms, which is helpful for work; the app keeps detailed records of heart rate, oxygen saturation percentage (when you take the measurement yourself), very detailed sleep quality results and all your sleep times... It compiles the data to give you an impressive look at the big picture - & explains everything!",5
Huawei Health,"Terrible app. Does not sync with the device which is working fine, every update affects the smart band which hangs, the sync process takes 10 minutes and does not sync alk the data from the smart band. Spent one hour to get some of it working. It looks like huawei is not able to test applications. I keep the product another week, if this does not get better I send the product back.",1
Huawei Health,"So after having problems with watch GT you finally corrected the software and it worked better. Now I made the mistake of getting the GT2 and wow the heart rate is a joke, just shoots up to 220 BPM and back down to 20 for no reason because I'm sitting down. I reset and I put tight and I did all but clearly it's a software problem. This I my last Huawei product. Btw getting those readings directly for the watch not the phone. But it's the same on the android phone.",1
Huawei Health,"Watch CONSTANTLY disconnecting and doesn't notify you, keep finding out when bluetooth symbol disappears after going into settings. Having to go in to the app, go to devices, reconnect device. Shame... It's got an amazing battery life, probably because it never connected. :( Believe it only has 3 functions, fitness monitor, notifications and clock.",1
Huawei Health,Only one thing i hate about it... why does this app needs to be connected to the internet all the time? You can't use this app without the internet connection! And that's Sucks! I would rate this app a HALF STAR because of this problem that a lot of people are complaining.,1
Huawei Health,Downloaded it for Huawei Watch Fit and it's supposed to track period. However the function requires two other apps which cannot be downloaded from Google Play to work. It's almost like a trap to bait you in to install a bunch of things from Huawei so Huawei can track more of your data lol. It lacks the robustness.,2
Huawei Health,"Needs a bit of smoothing out. Despite I'm running the latest version and my GT 2 Pro has also been updated to the latest firmware, there's no toggle switch to enable continuous SPO2 measurements... In mid-2018 I had the original GT watch. Using the app today after more than 2 years, it hasn't changed that much from what I remember.",3
Huawei Health,"Rest is fine but one is the biggest problem, is there no support for band 4 directly, you have to update list of supportive device, then only we can use the app, for the smart band 4, and still I'm not be able to update the list of supportive device on the oppo f9, I hope to see the new update that's supports band 4 directly ASAP",2
Huawei Health,"For some reason every time I try to put my height in, the app defaults back to 13'9"" - needless to say I am not that tall. It also keeps changing my weight after I try to set it - I do not know how to fix this, but other aspects of the app do seem to work well so far.",3
Huawei Health,i think its one of the best fitness apps...i've used mi fit google fit and some other apps to but so far I've felt the is one of the best.The previous apps that i used deprived of some feature or the other. The Huawei health app not only has the maximum features but has the best accuracy and is efficiently compatible with my Honor band 5i.,5
Huawei Health,After receiving some notifications I can not get any notification on my huawei watch gt2 though it is connected with my phone. I tried many steps as directed in the app in FAQ saction but the problem is not solved. I get notification only after reinstall the app and connect the watch again. But it is not possible to uninstall and reinstall again and again. Please solve the problem.,3
Huawei Health,"Overall fairly good. It would be nice if you could customize the features on the exercise choses. And GPS map for running, haven't met a jogger yet that didn't know where they were going . Still use wahoo as their layout for me really works. Don't use this app for real time data just upload later from the watch which is excellent.",3
Huawei Health,"I have GT Watch for 2 year's with no problem at all. The last 2 weeks just about the summer time has changed, nothing works. I saw tons of videos how to connect my gt with my Samsung Galaxy note 9 and I still cannot connect it either to my phone or through the health app. I reset it and downloaded the app more than 50 times and still nothing. Can the service Huawei team help me ,please? Thanks",5
Huawei Health,Using a mate 20 Pro with gt2. Device list won't update past 11% then crashes. I can't get past add a device after that it just black screens. I've tried clearing the cache/app data and uninstalling then reinstalling the app. The one time I got it to skip past looking for new devices and set up the watch I went to sleep it unpaired from my watch and wouldn't pair again. Good watch terrible app full of bugs. You would think if it would work on any device it would be on they're own products.,1
Huawei Health,"""Unable to login due to network error. Please try again later."" AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN! I have emailed in to ask for advice, but have not had a reply. Cannot login, so cannot see what my step counter device is tracking.",1
Huawei Health,"Several issues after the recent update on my Honor Magic Watch 2 46mm. 1. Not all notifications are displayed, even when all app notifications are enabled on the health app. 2. Sound Volume on the watch has dropped while making and receiving calls. Inbuilt music works fine. 3. Call logs aren't showing on the watch. 4. Battery on the watch lasts just for 7 days, even when the GPS is turned off.",1
Huawei Health,Sometimes app do not sync with watch. I need my data back. I use to do 10-15K for Oct 2020. All of a sudden I could not see 10k being tracked. I could not contact customer service as there seems to be no hotline or whatsapp help. Example: I was about 7500steps until 11.30pm and I ran 2.36kms which is more than 3000 steps for sure and that did not sync to health app. This is totally frustrating.looks like a bug. I need it to be fixed. Calories also did not sync properly.,1
Huawei Health,Does not work in Canada for hauwei smart scale CH18. Very disappointed. Lots of features available in other countries are not available in Canada. No way to backup sleep or heart data either. This would be an easy fix for the developers as it works for other regions. No watch face selector.,1
Huawei Health,"There's 3 issue i face 1. Sometime calories count jump by around 250kcal after motorcycle ride. 2. Dialy calorie graph are inaccurate. Sum of each bar in each hour of the day is only around 50% of total daily calorie burned. 3. Sometime calorie on app vs huawei watch fit are not the same. Even after sync. Otherwise it's the best app. Please developer, fix them .",4
Huawei Health,"Dear HUAWEI HEALTH, Two days ago I sent my review about a problem using my GT 2-E4B watch and the HUAWEI HEALTH application. Under ""steps"" counting, the ""achievements"" section would not update the counting thus the comparison to other users is unavailable. I did not receive any response from you till now BUT strangely, following app update of today(15th Nov 2020), the ""achievements"" simply disappeared...what is going on guys??",5
Huawei Health,"I the Huawei T3 with a fossil smartwatch. I don't get all the features and sometimes the watch disconnects from the phone, but overall the phone is it really good and I just use my phone when I want to track my exercise. No sense having too much technology unless it does something other then what the phone does. All in all I'm completely happy",5
Huawei Health,"It would be nice to be able to save one or two custom timers on watch gt2 and magic watch 2. Also, adding V2OMax to cycling exercises would be very helpful. Weather forcast should work with only watch GPS truned on, but it works only when phone location is turned on. There should be option to add location manually. All watch faces should allow you to choose which information to show in the available fileds, like heart rate, stress level.",3
Huawei Health,I would really appreciate an easy way to export the data in a standard file format like csv or xml or gpx in case of tracks. Transfer of tracks from the GT2 watch to this app is very scetchy. The watch appears to register gps signals ok but only a small part of these data gdts transferred to the app. As many others i would like to be able to deselect step counting devices e.g. when carryimg both a watch and a phone. What is really ennoying is that max heart rate is consistently reset to 190,1
Huawei Health,I purchased the gt2 pro for the update on Spo2 continuous monitoring. The firmware has been updated to 10.1.2.52 and others have posted about the toggle to do so. My app does not support this. I am hoping that this could be regional or there would be a fix to enable in the app. Thanks.,2
Huawei Health,"Very Poor app and watch experience coming from Garmin. I REALLY regret going backwards to Huewel. I now have my time wasted to sell and migrate back, the watch features could be good, if you could export data to a useable app I would probably still keep the system. Happy with the way the watch looks like overall EXTREMELY DISSAPPONTED about everything else. UPDATE I've now bought a Garmin and once it arrives life will soon be good again",1
Huawei Health,requires permissions and access to cellphone infra it should not similar to what viruses do. it forces user to create an account and does not support unauthenticated use for something that should not be more than personal firness tracking. It does not allow me to remove it on my phone.,1
Huawei Health,"I bought a gt2e ft o use with my Discovery vitality. The watch sync with the Huawei Health, but health does not sync with vitality. Looks like a major problem and no solution from either Huawei or Discovery. Losing points and rewards because I listened to the sales lady and didn't buy a Garmin. I need a solution soon or returning the watch as it does not fulfill the purpose it was bought for.",2
Huawei Health,"Please for the love of everything holy, fix the notifications issue! I've restarted my phone, uninstalled the app, installed the app, disconnected my watch, connected my watch, nothing pushes notifications to my watch! Handled settings on the app, nothing. Handled settings on my phone, NOTHING! Nothing seems to work in regards to notifications. It works for the fitness and everything else but seriously, the notifications issue is a HUGE problem. Please look into it and fix it. Thanks!",2
Huawei Health,"from 2-3 weeks at least the app is unable to sync to Google fit, so it's partially unusefull. in particular the heart rate (HRM) graphs are totally striped out, and some time does not send short workout (f.e. 15 mins cycling) ... so also the very good honor band products lost their goodness. it could be better to choose polar ones. it's a pity.",2
Huawei Health,"Hi Huawei team, Good app, works well with Huawei watch fit. Will be more enjoyable if we can add customized Personal Challenges based on Running distance, Walking steps, etc. Can even more enjoyable to send Challenges invite based on customized challenges. Hope to have these options in future updates. Thanks.",4
Huawei Health,"Useless app. Doesnot have Honor band 5 in the list of devices to be paired. Whenever you click to update the list, it says no internet vonnection although my laptop, phone and other devices are running on the same wifi. Waste of money to buy a device when the app support is so poor",1
Huawei Health,"Still there's no option to chose the source of step count, the app automatically merges data from phone and the band. This is extremely inaccurate! Tons of people complain about this missing feature for YEARS! This could be fixed easily, yet Huawei still don't care about the feedback of their customers. Shame on you! Guess what? Never gonna spend money on Huawei products because of 0 customer support.",1
Huawei Health,"Terrible bugs in step counting and activity tracking make this app utterly useless (e.g., all statistics and report features become irrelevant). The app shows that I ran 0.1km for 30 minutes, or that I took over 265,000 steps (over 200km) today. While actually, I went for a 5k run and drove max 10km today, so it's not even about counting steps while driving (which it also occasionally does). All in all, while the OS on the band itself works perfectly, this phone app ruins the whole experience.",2
Huawei Health,"It's still got a few bugs....which need fixing. The step count on the app activity tracker shows different figures to what's on the device, as it is with sleep. Exercise tracker for Treadmill showed me 800 steps after walking for over an hour. I don't know how accurate the app is or the device too.",3
Huawei Health,I have loved this in the past but now it won't let me update the watch list to reconnect. I just bought a new phone and now its daylight savings time. I have a 5 and it will only show me up to 3. Won't update list of watches so my watch is now an hour fast and I can't fix it....,1
Huawei Health,"In Honor Band 5, heart rate limit and maximum heart rate cannot function properly after it is set. Always returns to the default, which is 190. Please fix it. - I wish, i can auto pause exercise, when I'm not moving. Just like Strava, there is an auto pause.",2
Huawei Health,"Horrible time display. When looking for time in the middle of the night burns your retina. The toggle screen always seems on the wrong type (I only walk and swim. I don't want to toggle through useless types). Exercise update voice in horrible American male voice and accent. Otherwise ok except for useless list of models when pairing being that wearable does not have it printed (""is it 2b? Pro? Xyz ? Couldn't it just show the one it's near?)",1
Huawei Health,"It used to be a good app, not sure after the new update or what, I have stopped getting the notifications, in my magic watch2, it's enabled in the app, also followed all the suggested paths in the phone too, permissions enabled, still I don't get any notification.",3
Huawei Health,"I bought this thinking i could use this for open water swimming. Far from efficient, as i couldnt close the app after i finished. Would have been great to have been able to tell the actual water temp too. Also the sleep function is ineffective.",2
Huawei Health,"Not much user friendly to use, Bluetooth does not auto connect, it does not shows in scan,device name is not shown in bluetooth scan list but still it connect ,I guess that's a bug to be solved,Cannot see data in app offline you need to manually connect even if its paired .App does not open offline.Most of the Honor watch ES features are not shown in app,require to update features,Need lot of improvement as compared to other Health apps.After that it can be eligible for 5 star rating",2
Huawei Health,App is broken. For the amount you pay for the watch I expect a functioning app. It will not let me use metric values... weight and height will not save and reset to silly values. I'm forced to use imperial and even then it is hit or miss to get it to save! Had to try several times. Dissapointing as watch uses hight and weight data to calculate estimated calorie burn and BMI ... So it's imperative your hight and weight are correct.,1
Huawei Health,"Absolute farce. Just bought a Huawei Watch Fit, tried to pair and it's not even on the list of supported watches. App advised me to update it but it won't update, constantly says no network connection which is nonsense - if I had no connection I wouldn't be writing this.",1
Huawei Health,"I'm using this with Honor Band 5,More customisation required in the app like heart rating only continuous available but it has to more options like every half an hour like so & some features ike SPO2 only we can access manually through Band but no option in the app which is very bad So app need to be more customised like Mi fit App please update",3
Huawei Health,"I just explored this app. And one of the most basic starting settings is not there. Height!! You can ad your wheight, but no other physical detail. So basically this whole app serves no real purpose. Wheight and height are directly related to eachother to determine one important health factor nl. your BMI. So you can add you're 105kg. But the app doesn't keep record to know if you're a short fat guy in need of more activity or a skinny 2m high that needs to eat more carbs.",1
Huawei Health,"Edit: clearing the cache seemed to help the syncing problems. It's buried somewhere in the menus. _____________ Recently have been having major syncing problems — very slow, gets to 99% then fails. Can't edit sleep records when the tracker messed it up, or if I slept without it on. Step count seems off.",2
Huawei Health,"I'm using Huawei GT2e watch.... All over app is good but I found that data is inconsistent in heart rate zone when compared with the watch. For Example watch shows I'm in aerobic zone for 2 minutes, whereas app shows less than a minute in the same workout.",4
Huawei Health,"Phone works better as per original app. Update ruins its entire performance. Bluetooth calling not working, no connectivity with stress and heart rate monitor. Overall, latest update ruined magicwatch 2. I realised the bug in software after installing in another mobile.",1
Huawei Health,It's very easy to use I can get in track of my sleep and stress level throughout the day and the week the month event year. The problem is I can't start workout without using the phone and through the internet using data in my SIM. I prefer pressing long and the workout start. Or an option in the watch to start the workout. Running or walking or cycling... then when the workout is finished the data from the watch can uploaded to the phone.,4
Huawei Health,"So far I can't complain about this app, I'm using it everyday and everything is working perfectly. Few times I had some problems with my smart watch and the GPS but above that I highly recommend it!!",5
Huawei Health,"Works all right. Location needed to connect to my wearable Bluetooth device is a bit too much for me. Also doesn't count my ""outdoor walks"" when I push a stroller. The distance is measured but because it's not registering most of my steps (hand is fairly motionless on the handlebar of the stroller) it says data is abnormal (I assume it's the stride-length of more than 2m because of many unregistered steps).",2
Huawei Health,"Updated 21-11-2020 So surprised to find this app works again! I really like the TrueSleep technology. Under CoVid-19 it is very important to keep our body in good shape so the Workout is really useful. Glad that new exercises have been added too. Keep up, Huawei 👍🏻!",5
Huawei Health,"The watch itself works fine, but the turn of the year has made sleep tracking impossible. The watch shows you how much you have slept, but the app doesn't sync it. Few times it has deleted all sleep data from the watch while trying to sync. Oct 2020 edit: The app is still quite fickle when it comes to sleep tracking but it has improved a little.",2
Huawei Health,The app is good without the step count feature. It counts my phone steps source. And when i travel they collect extra step count from mobile. Need to separate this from app. Please update this. If i use my band or watch and i did not get proper data than why should i use this? This is totally useless. You should stop the step count from phone. Otherwise i will stop wearing the fitness band. Thanks.,2
Huawei Health,"Why do you need GPS to connect Bluetooth device ? Most probably you're trying to spy on us. It doesn't let you connect your band if you don't allow location permission. It also asks for phone, call, contacts, notifications access permission even if I turn off all the features like caller ID or notification reminder. This app should be removed from Play Store for asking too much permissions, I know these are required, but why keep asking for it if I don't use it ? Better use your band standalone",1
Huawei Health,"In general it's a solid app, but every time I open the running plans menu there's instability and constant crashing, often persisting even through reboots and only going away after some time. This makes a key feature practically unusable.",3
Huawei Health,"Connect to this app and there is nothing to do with this app, no text message, no face app tap or option to download another faceapp for the watch. Pretty much useless other than just to update the software. I wish maybe in the future this app could access to phone photos, voice to text and many features.",1
Huawei Health,"I don't have the ""discovery"" button: it appears first time you install (or reinstall) the app, and when opening the app a second time it disappears forever, as with other features. Looks like i'm missing experiences, community and challenges just because i don't have a Huawei phone but just the band. Nice marketing move? Well I'm not supporting it.",1
Huawei Health,"The app has been updated now, but altitude is way off... I could have done maybe 500m, but shows over 6000. But it is improvement, at least I havent got in a -200m now.. also, it would bw good to have average every kilometer, not 5.",3
Huawei Health,"This app is awesome.....it helped me connect to my smart watch. But there is an issue. The notification, the gmail one. In my phone my Papa also signed in the gmail. So it also shows the hundred different messages that appear for him....so I would like it if we were able to choose which account we want the notification to come from......but otherwise is ok.....",4
Huawei Health,I am facing the following issues now with honor band 5. Device does not auto reconnect with bluetooth. Device is not shown in the paired device list. I have to manually setup and pair sevice everytime the connection is lost. Device is also not displayed in the Available list. I am using Note 9 pro max device.,2
Huawei Health,"I would have given a 5 star rating but for these few annoying issues. I'm using the honor watch GT 2, the watch it self was working great until the last firmware update ruined the GPS locking. Earlier it used lock to a GPS signal early and would keep a steady connection but now it takes too long and also doesn't keep a steady lock. Also, the step counting is not very accurate as it also adds the steps data from the phone and duplicates the steps when used together. Other issue I have observed is that there is no real time/automatic sync with Google FIT. Need to manually sync every time. Last but not the least, Heart rate data is not shared with Google Fit for some strange reason. Amazfit devices share all the data with Google Fit and the sync is automatic. Please fix these annoying issues and I'll update the rating to 5*. Thanks.",3
Huawei Health,"Thanks to Team. Great achievement. Just used 3 days before and looks everything is fine going. I have seen minor problems of syncing to the mobile device on real time, which is lacking, watch face is displaying some value and the mobile device. Other than each feature is very well developed with extreme care to match with the exact value that I have tested with professional medical devices. SpO2 is not bad, stress test is also very near. Is it possible to keep any watch face on Standby mode?",5
Huawei Health,The app looks good but there are a lot of wrong things on it like it works only online and it doesn't reconnect automatically with the watch and also sometimes it can't connect at all and you have to unpair the watch to connect again.,3
Huawei Health,I am using Magicwatch 2. Couple of days back watch got updated. Now the watch take more time to detect GPS in outdoors. Please fix the issue. Nice application. Please provide more analog based watch faces. Still facing GPS connection issues in outside activities. Please also add female voice in the smart companion. Need a time schedule for RAISE TO WAKE feature like other apps provides.,4
Huawei Health,"It's ok but there are a couple of things I would like. Can you change the annoying American voice in the running app. Can I change the distance to miles in the running app? Overall,. I think it's better than the Samsung equivalent app. Update,. Have changed the km to Miles. I am a biff!",4
Huawei Health,CANNOT CHANGE WATCH FACES?!! Causes HUGE battery drain on vivo nex 3. unacceptable. Why does this run so much in background? Samsung apps or Google watch apps don't cause so much battery drain. Also- WHY DO YOU NEED LOCATION ACCESS ALL THE TIME? spying piece of grabage!,1
Huawei Health,"Its good. Need some improvements like Lift wrist to view should give option of schedule so that at night, it will not glow as and when one is moving his hand while sleeping. This option is available in ""Mi Fit"". One should be able to share Photo with route map like ""Sports Tracker"". Should have ""Auto Pause/Resume"" options.",2
Huawei Health,"Paired with Huawei Watch Fit. I cannot install watch faces, it keeps on failed after the installation process. And also I cannot find where is the ""answer the phone call"" option? Also why we have to turn on the location service in order to run the apps?? I understand this may be caused of the development stage of this device, but please fix this asap to enhance our excitement in using this device.",2
Huawei Health,The app seamlessly gets connected and has a vast information on fitness. When I see the watcj faces section it shows in Chinese language and not in English. also it doesn't load many times. any idea how can this be solved?,4
Huawei Health,"The sleep and activity trackers work well, but there should be a calorie counter and food input aspect to the app. Really disappointed I had to download another app and I can't sync my daily total of calories consumed and burned!",3
Huawei Health,"Can't connect to my watch, a few days ago I updated the watch system and since then I can't connect to the watch, I can't find the watch in the app and the list update doesn't work. Tried to get in touch with the developer and no response",1
Huawei Health,"Not really commensurate to the trends of the fitness community. No features like sharing your activities with friends or adding and inviting other like-minded people, which is what other apps offer and seems to be the most attractive feature there is to offer. I don't really use it for running, the only best feature is counting my steps, which is great for monitoring my NEAT and avoid sedentary lifestyle. I use the auto detect feature for my runs, but it sometimes doesn't detect my runs nor sync",3
Huawei Health,"I use this app with my huawei band, it records sleep quality, heart rate, and excercise. In geberal, it works very well. The user interface is neat and easy to get around, information provided is thorough.",5
Huawei Health,Since the last update is almost impossible to track my sleep. The data is wrong and I think I lost the info from several days already. I see the amount of hours in my band but if I want the detail in the app... IMPOSSIBLE.,1
Huawei Health,"Well the app has given me good stats and information and pointed me to things I can improve in my whole life. Everything works great, I've paired it up with the Honor GS pro and all the information is kept there, then transferred over when I sync it in the morning. Can see my sleep patterns and if I had slept too much or too little and tips how to fix it.",5
Huawei Health,"Everything works fine except text messages notifications, spend a lot of time time trying to fix that, but I guess is that app or watch problem because everything works except text messages. Probably return my watch for refund",2
Huawei Health,Very good application. But please give an option to delete pre installed watch faces or provide more space for watch faces because there are some which I dont want and I have to delete the ones which I like to install new ones . please fix this,4
Huawei Health,"App has been throwing all wrong data and has multiple flaws. 1) for a activity, with all parameters being same the calorie count has gone down to half. 2) App is picking cycling distance and showing that in foot steps count. 3) cycling link shows approx 400 cal, main page shows double of that ? Whole app has gone haywire",1
Huawei Health,Wow! It's a great app for your tracking device and even I can change the faces in my Huawei Band 4. I put a four star because no updates come so in this update for all tracking devices it needs a lock screen but with just the regular old swipe lock and also please add a new feature of making our own custom watch faces. Then this will be rated a 5 star app please do the suitable changes.,5
Huawei Health,"Since doing an update in October my heart rate has been jumping to 135 at random points in a day, this is also happening on my husbands device, never any higher....... very strange, needs fixing, or no point in using",2
Huawei Health,App on Android won't remember my height & weight. And you have to create a Chinese-location Huawei account to change watchfaces. Not interested in workarounds to use features I technically paid for; I guess the tracker (Honor 5i) is being returned.,1
Huawei Health,"Terrible app, won't update devices due to network error, there is nothing wrong with my network connection. As a result I can't use my new smart watch so I'll have to return it, buy a better brand like garmin /samsung",1
Huawei Health,"Good app but buggy. Issues that have been going on a long time have not been fixed. I also think crazy that I can't install it on my Huawei tablet , incompatible apparently!",3
Huawei Health,It also combines phone step counts along with band. So each step is counted twice and hence the result is not accurate which completely ruins the app. Please fix this as it's of utmost importance.,1
Huawei Health,"My sleep data sync kept stopping at 77%.It finally worked out after I did this: 1-Unpair the bluetooth between your phone & band. On your phone make sure to 'forget' the band name at bluetooth 2-Log out from Huwaei Health App, unistal then instal the App. Log in to App and go to 'Add device', select your band type/generation to be added to the App. This step is necessary because after uninstalling the listing will be erased 3-Pair band and phone via bluetooth. Sleep data should sync properly now",3
Huawei Health,"Will Huawei Health App ever fix the weight and height issue of it changing to some random data and then to alter the calorie burnt in the process when trying to input the correct data makes it impossible to keep track of any resemblance of accurate stats. It is a joke it hasn't yet been fixed. An 8 mile walk ended up with 20,000 calories burnt after I tried to input my correct stats. Grrrrr",1
Huawei Health,"App interface is not catchy, not too much data in proper presentation, should add animations, video, new features, daily new look, reminders, to do list, integrate with Amazon music, you tube etc. Watch should have different animation, video play, prayer times, to do list, reply to notification, dialpad",2
Huawei Health,Love the watch but why is it that we can't choose more options in canada?! Like watchfaces in the app?! And i can't pair my wireless earphones and cannot change song from my phone with the watch and thats only here in canada. Fix it please,3
Huawei Health,"When paired huawei watch gt2e with app, the step counter shows triple, quadruple amounts compared to reality. Huawei fails to fix issue for over a year, repeating the same message - we told technical team, we don't know anything. Complete disregard of customers, and a disappointment. I feel cheated.",1
Huawei Health,App doesnt always work smoothly on android phone. Was kind of a nightmare and thought i was going to have to return my band because it app would not update the band list even though it updated the watch list finally after install and unistall over and over again i was able to update list and find my product to activate luckily,3
Huawei Health,"Solid app, updates really add value. Wish I could customize the alarm. Different sound or (custom) vibration only. Watchfaces load slow and are shown double in overview. Not a big fan of the color scheme, but all in all I consider this one of the better health tracking apps at the moment.",4
Huawei Health,"Decent app, but they need to fix the inaccurate step count caused by having multiple sources. The simple fix would be an option to turn off the phone as a source and just use the watches data. Ugly 'heart' icon in top menu too - please make the colour customisable.",3
Huawei Health,"Now moved to 2 stars as it tracked sleep for about a week and then stopped working again. Pretty rubbish. Was working wonderful. But no sleep tracking since the 9th September 2020 Reinstalled the app and it re synced, but still no sleep update. Now over a moth later and the watch is showing how much sleep but not the app. Please fix this",2
Huawei Health,Need to fix profile. Everytime I open my app I have to enter correct height and weight. Everytime. Also why is it for USA and Canada we don't have a watch gallery on the app and only on the watch itself? You're a huge company and yet you can't give us the best of what other countries have. You can do it.,3
Huawei Health,I bought a gt2 watch and it's really nice work great with the application but what I lack in the application is that you can't add another workout type just walk or run. On watch I got options like rowing and such but not in the application.,4
Huawei Health,"en using this ever since i got my huawei fitness watch. Very easy to understand and no problems so far for over a year. The only thing that does bug me is that it has trouble syncing with Google Fit. Probably a bug on both companies, so i have to remind myself to manually input my records in google.",5
Huawei Health,"The app is fine but there are a couple of sync issues with the band: Doesn't seem to work with Amazon Music. And the new weather update feature, doesn't sync properly with the band",4
Huawei Health,"Pairing keep on failing recently for this. Honor band 5i. Keep on asking to restart the band and restart the bluetooth. But, no use of anything. Band is of no use if it fails to connect.",1
Huawei Health,Glitchy and unfinished. Can't set weight or height due to it saving random numbers. Often putting me at 13 ft 6 inches tall when I save it as 5 foot 6. This skews all my results making the tracking pointless.,1
Huawei Health,"I am facing lot of lag issue the application gets stuck whenever I open it... Its so much annoying whenever I go out for run it stucks and I feel so much bad when it happens specially when you are in a motivated mood... I really love this app please try to fix the issue ❤️🙏 Thanks and Regards, Divesh.",1
Huawei Health,It pretty morose that you'd have no feature to export the data from the device. You have to request a download and get a link to download from Huawei server. It also asks for way too many invasive permissions. This app is a sad accompaniment to the the otherwise good wearable,1
Huawei Health,"It's good in that it is able to track and estimate the calories burned during running or walking or biking.... But it heavily depends on you switching your location on, and wants all sorts of permissions.... And I've had to reinstall it due to the app behaving buggy after a few month of initial use.",3
Huawei Health,"Sleep not syncing. Huawei Band shows usually 7-8h of sleep per night but the Health app shows random 2-3h naps during the night time. Did everything, including software updates and data wipe but no success. Please help - it makes the app useless for me.",3
Huawei Health,"Very easy to use once your android and watch are synchronised. Your watch my not appear in the bluetooth sync, but you will get on outline of it, just tap that and hopefully you are on you way. Enjoy",5
Huawei Health,"In the next update, the features of Huawei Honor Watch 2 need to be updated as well, there should be a provision to change the ringtone of the watch so that there will be some new changes.",5
Huawei Health,"There had been some problems but thanks to the update they were fixed. Huawei does not allow us to add custom watch faces, it is almost the only problem for now.",4
Huawei Health,"Works brilliantly. There's a new update, but I don't see it yet. New update has dynamic tracking which looks awesome on my wife's phone. I want that feature.",5
Huawei Health,I cant add new watch face which is one of the basics of smart watches. I don't know why but i surfaced the net and the only way for that is to be in china region. Tai chi method is also useless for me. Also there is no way to install 3th party apps to my watch such as navigation. Health monitoring is very good and lovely.,2
Huawei Health,"I've discovered recently that in order to start training activity in the app, you must grand the app permission to use your location all the time, not just while using the app. When I set the permission to use my location only while using the app, I was unable to start training. Why?",1
Huawei Health,After installation of this application on my phone is hang many times . So uninstalled it. Now phone is working well. Also this app drains phone battery so fast . Could not recommend this app and honor band 5.,1
Huawei Health,Nice app for Huawei band 4 pro and keeping running stats. Too bad SpO2 measurements from the band do not sync back to the app. Also frequently loses Bluetooth connection to the band and reconnection is very finicky.,3
Huawei Health,can not update the device list ... the same message every time. check your network connection. this rating is from the same network connection.,1
Huawei Health,"App Keeps crashing, won't keep history of exercise. Uninstall and reinstall loses exercise history as well. I like all the features but isn't worth keeping it or upgrading watch if app can't keep up to par.",1
Huawei Health,"The only thing bothering me is the step count combines the result both from phone and the watch without merging it, so the number will be doubled. Hope Huawei will fix this soon.",4
Huawei Health,It's ok. But the main gripe is it doesn't hold personal data. Apparently it's decided I'm 12 ft tall and weigh 29lbs!!!! Believe me I'm not! Anyone know how to fix this?,3
Huawei Health,"The Huawei watch always best. But the Huawei authority must look about Huawei watch faces specially band 4. In Huawei band watch there is a major problem that to change time Huawei health needed, but if we change time by watch manually it's pretty good. Thank you .",5
Huawei Health,enable the option to count steps from only the watch connected. I'm getting double the steps I've walked because I always carry my phone with me and the app adds the steps from my phone and watch. This is ridiculous. How difficult it is to solve this???,1
Huawei Health,I can't be able to update the latest version of cycling tracker. It says to update on HMS Core and the location is in the AppGallery. I did try to search for it but couldn't find it. You may want to help me direct where I can download the latest version. THANK YOU!!!,1
Huawei Health,"App maintains a good connection with the smart watch. Also this app is being good throughout my usage. There is some bugs when accessing the watch face that it won't load up properly. I suggestion to make is kindly add more watch faces to play with, it would be a good move for the users.",5
Huawei Health,Hi. Here want to say couple of things. 1-why there is no notification on lock screen? I have to unlock My watch fit 05a every single time. And Swype to see notification. 2.every morning the watch is disconnected and is hard to connect back. I don't know is app or watch. Any ideas? Thank you,1
Huawei Health,"Don't buy the Huawei Watch GT 2e they are no longer being supported, they are only supporting their new watches now. I have one that's completely useless, it's not pairing with the phone and the app, when I attempt to pair it it says that the device is not supported. I have a $200 watch just sitting there. Complete waste of money",1
Huawei Health,"Earlier REM sleep time and score was displayed in the app. But now they are missing since last 10 days. Though I sent mail to developer, I didn't get a response. I bought the Honor band 5 mainly for sleep analysis. Highly disappointed.",2
Huawei Health,Good application. Keeps very good data. After use of 13 days it stopped showing notification in watch. Above issue is solved after multiple reinstallation of huawei health application but now huawei .login option is missing.,4
Huawei Health,My device cannot be added because it isn't showing. I have a Honor Band 5. Cannot pair or add device as there is no such device shown in the list. When i try to update the list it is getting cancelled,2
Huawei Health,"When Honor band 4 is restarted even at continuous heat rate mode off, device keeps monitoring heart rate. Please fix this bug. After update 1.0.10.78 sleeping monitoring become inaccurate, earlier it was accurate.",1
Huawei Health,"Huawei seriously, open up LiteOs a little bit more. It's too closed, user cant do anything, even xiaomi bands have better customization. We need custom watchfaces! Please make pedometer optional on device! It feels like that not even you use your own product and not aware of the problems.",1
Huawei Health,Most of the watch faces disappeared from the app. There's no way to add custom watch faces. Are you trying to monetize watch faces? Is there a watch faces store that I'm missing? I'm fine with paying for watch faces if there's such an option. But the stock ones are rather meh. I'm using a Magic Watch 2.,2
Huawei Health,"I have spent quite a bit of money on various Huawei smart watches just to be let down by this terrible app. You have been informed time and time again that there are problems but you dont even try to fix it. Currently according to Huawei I am 13'7 tall and weigh 13 pounds, it will not let me set my maximum heart rate which is a real issue for a 65 year old.",1
Huawei Health,"Old original review [with some corrections] below, but inserting this comment that is firming up my two-star rating. New version of Health adds Stress, but I cannot find out if stress testing works with my Huawei Band 2 Pro (which I've already owned for almost a year). I'm guessing no, it doesn't measure stress. Nothing helpful in the ""Help"" and still no way to contact Huawei. As usual, Huawei's clever hardware seems to offer good value, but the support is deficient. Maybe it's better if I read",3
Huawei Health,Not working with Motorola...error ...HMS core....also I don't understand is it a fitness app or bank app..... dangerous security.....I guess Huawei developers need to be more realistic on that what they want to develop fitness app or bank app....very annoying if you want to login and forgot the password.....why do you need password...code....phone no....account creation... OTP...email.......bla....bla... for a app which counts your steps....,1
Huawei Health,"I am unable to connect my new watch GT 2E from this app. It shows to update the device list, but it doesn't gets updated, tried updating from mobile data and wifi too. This is really disappointing stuff.",1
Huawei Health,Good so far. Please add these features mainly for the Honor Band 5 Sport Edition. 1.Stop Watch 2.Timer 3.Allow for changing the alarm snooze time from its default value of 10 minutes to any time in minutes.,3
Huawei Health,"When İ add honor magic watch 2 through the app, it disables the phone audio in bluethooth options which stops receiving and sending phone calls. İ am using a Huawei P8, android v.6 and watch firmware is up to date. Could you please advise as soon as possible?",2
Huawei Health,"I have a gt2 watch. I also have a plethora of other sports watches (Garmin, Tomtom etc). Only two upgrades shall nail the competition here. One adding customized watch faces and two syncing to other third party apps like strava etc. Hoping the same shall be included in upcoming upgrades.",4
Huawei Health,"Happy with the app overall. Still figuring out how to add more watch faces (external app), as watch face quality needs some improvements. GPS accuraty good enough during exercise.",4
Huawei Health,Thanks for fixing the issues with watch faces on the huawei app. It now sync well with LG phone. There's a small issue still on using the menstrual cycle function. Huawei health app said to download HMS Core to use it but can't find HMS Core anywhere to download. Hope this can resolve as well.,4
Huawei Health,"Cannot update the device list, even though the network connection is stable. Plenty of users has the same issue and no solution from Huawei so far.",1
Huawei Health,"I even don't go somewhere and got counted 1500 foot steps,the honor band don't count my any of records then why the app showing this.also the band is not transfering data to the phone.no matching options or any improvement or drecreasing events",1
Huawei Health,Edited review after few months. Nearly accurate step counter with good tracking of basic activities are there in this app. Hr tracking also is good. Sleep cycle is described better than mi but sometimes it's not accurate while tracking. Hope huawei fixes this problem,4
Huawei Health,"Why do you need location etc and so many things, it's a simple tracker just give an app that's counts our movements. By all the terms and conditions your intentions don't seem to be clear in case of a simple tracker. Your previous versions were better.",1
Huawei Health,Doesn't have the same functions on a Samsung phone as compared to Huawei phones. So the wearable experience is much different. Huawei must make sure the same function are available on other phones like clock face and Achievements. Updating the app you must install Huawei App gallery.,1
Huawei Health,"I wish Huawei has at least one Mondphase Watchface if I can't buy at Google Play due to Huawei's ban. The sleep Monitoring from GT2 looks impressive, but WRONG! I checked few times, I wasn't in Rem sleep at all, but awake, just in bed not moving with my mind thinking about few problems. Bought Huawei to support Google's ban, but Huawei let us customers alone.",1
Huawei Health,"With recent updates, has stopped auto sync to Google Fit. And even after manual sync, it fails to sync previous days. This app gives more headaches than any health benefits!",1
Huawei Health,Cant connect it to my phone... before i was using galaxy note 8 and the app was working fine. Now i have galaxy s20+ and the app doesnt even open says the page can not be found... so now what? I buy it for nothing?,1
Huawei Health,I am using honour band 5. This app not reconnects to band automatically. Manually need to connect because of this missing calls and other notifications. This is very basic need of a band so because of this I wanted to give zero star.,1
Huawei Health,WORST APP EVER! I entered my weight and height and it keeps changing back to 14'1 and 61kgs so the calories burned is completely off. It also has a permanent message notification that I can't get rid of. It's not a very intuitive app. I'm extremely disappointed. DON'T BUY ANY HUAWEI PRODUCTS! THEY GIVE ZERO SUPPORT!!!!,1
Huawei Health,"App is good. I have been usin watch magic 1 for last one week. Serious reconnection issues exist. Once the watch goes out of range, it does not reconnect automatically. Have to reconnect it manually every time. Developers pls take a note.",4
Huawei Health,"Doesn't accurately record runs. In fact there are massive inaccuracies. The watch is very nice, but i will stick to fitbit in future.",2
Huawei Health,Good experience..very informative apps to monitor your activities..but sometimes unable to reconnect with watch..i need to restart phone & reconnect..overall I am satisfied with this apps.,4
Huawei Health,"I very like this app!!! It's very cool and very clever app in the world! But this app has disadvantages! Please developers add the customization languages, it's very important thing. Believe me!",4
Huawei Health,"It worked pretty fine for a couple of weeks but now i cannot connect it anymore to my device Honor Band 5, it appears ""device not supported"" every time i try to pair",2
Huawei Health,"Upgraded my band from mi band 4 to huawei gt watch fit, the function I used the most which is to switch songs is always unavailable here, unlike in mi fit, huawei health is always not running in background I guess, eventhough I locked it in recent apps",3
Huawei Health,Good app easy to use and keep basic records As a personal trainer I have to keep track of clients progress so don't have much time for my own. Bad I know but this helps however under armour's apps are better. So would suggest that Huawei up the game by adding macro nutrient tracker etc.,5
Huawei Health,I'm using honor band 5i I have problem with watch face there are only 80 watch face I like them but can you add 1000+ watch face and can you add camera control and in workout there is indoor cycling can you add outdoor cycling then I will give 5 star.,2
Huawei Health,"1: Pls allow uploading photos from gallery as background while sharing the stats on social media. Just like Runtastic or Adidas App. 2: Can't upload photos on the App profile. Pls sort out the issue. 3: Also pls allow sharing achievements against multiple goals, just like Runtastic! Rest looks to be fine and in order.",2
Huawei Health,I like the app very much. The only downside is that it doesn't connect with my calorie counting app so can't merge the exercise data.,4
Huawei Health,Very nice app. Fast synching data. Please enable to add our friends and to see thier walking and running count... So it's kind of motivational (healthy competition).,5
Huawei Health,"The app is a little bit working slow, Hope you update the app to a better version especialy with the steps and calories history.. even hoping to change theme colors or just make it something optional to choose. Wishing that you add swimming activity to the sports 🙏🏻",2
Huawei Health,Could be a lot better. The app looks nice but I have a few issues with the app aswell with my honor magic watch 2. 1. There should be an option to disable the step count from your phone. 2. The watch detects a lot of steps as climbing while driving a car because of the changes in altitude. This can be easily 'fixed' by adding an option to disable tracking while driving. 3. The heart rate sensor sometimes loses my heart rate while exercising dropping very low. This is very frustrating.,3
Huawei Health,Need to fix the bug on the bpm. Heat rate maximum limit keeps on reverting back to 190 bpm even though i have already change it to reflect the bpm per age. Keeps on reverting back.,4
Huawei Health,The app itself is very accomplished for arguably the most technologically advanced health watches on the market and works faultlessly. The only minus is the lack (compared to other manufacturers) of quality watch faces/themes hence the 4 not 5 stars. Please Huawei more classic and informative and less childish and totally tasteless faces as your selection of watch themes does not do justice to your very technological advanced selection of health watches.,4
Huawei Health,I am new user. The magic watch 2 has GPS issues. It takes a generation to get the GPS signal and its not stable. Hardly get the strength to 2 bars even on a clear sky day. Will it be fixed???,1
Huawei Health,Great app. Have very helpful features. Amazing interface. One thing needs to be adeed; that it need to count calories during rest & during sleep.,4
Huawei Health,When I sleep with the watch to track sleeping but it increases the step count as well. I don't walk at night. 🤣 How it increase?? 😂😂 Disgusting technical team with worst algorithm.,1
Huawei Health,I cant seem to install other watch faces other than the default versions! So please fix this since i'm using samsung note 20 ultra. Really disappointed because I thought it will be comptaible with other android devices,2
Huawei Health,"I bought an Honor 5 with the primary purpose of tracking sleep data synched to Google Fit. Steps are synching to Fitz but not sleep data, making this basically useless for my purposes.",1
Huawei Health,"At first it was hard to figure out but now I love this app, it's super helpful with tracking workouts and steps! Would recommend to anyone looking for a health app 😁",4
Huawei Health,Dear app developer . There is a bug in your app which doesn't allow me to connect with my Samsung j3 (2016). I tried all the possibility but not working out.,1
Huawei Health,"I am using Huawei watch fit and connected in my Samsung galaxy S8 plus. After undated, the notification responses are working well. But the camera shutter is still not available in my phone. Hope it will be solved soon.",3
Huawei Health,"It is a good app, but even though it knows my birth date, it can't correctly calculate my heart zones, meaning my calories spent is always wrong.",4
Huawei Health,"I like the honor band hardware, but it is completely ridiculous that the health app is so poorly handled. Some functions work. Some just don't. I can't even set up my profile as it refuses to let me set my age or sex despite my using a current flagship phone (S10). These are amateur hour issues. I am shocked this is being released by an actual big company. If someone made a paycheck from this mess, they laughed all the way home.",2
Huawei Health,"Love the app, gives me all the details I need, easy to use. No syncing issue, unlike fitbit who I will never go back to. Thank you Huawei",5
Huawei Health,Works well most of the time. Takes a while to sync sleep with band pro 4. Needs export to gpx capability. Doesn't remember maximum heart rate setting for zones.,3
Huawei Health,Always my go to app for exercise tracking since I purchased my Honor mobile. The different modes of exercises and outdoors path created using Maps are undoubtedly the best features.,5
Huawei Health,"Limited scope, doesn't let me change the default ringtone. And privacy filter should be there like whose calls I don't want on my watch to be displayed.",3
Huawei Health,@HuaweiHealth Hello team! I have been using honor band 5i...The latest weather update and other bug fixes were extremely excellent but I and others are expecting the custom watch face..Which we can apply our own image in the background... I hope Huawei Health Team can bring out the expecting update both in firmware and the app Regards giridar,3
Huawei Health,"Don't keep asking me for location, contacts and phone logs again and again! When I rejected them, it means I don't want to give access.. why the app keeps asking me!!!",1
Huawei Health,It did not work on motorola one vision. It was show that need new version of app gallery which i installd but even that it continue to show the same. So i installed HMS core and now works perfect. But yes it drains the battery,4
Huawei Health,"Can't set heat rate, it always reverts to 190, no matter what I do. If not fixed, then this band is completely useless. Please fix ASAP",1
Huawei Health,This app would be way better if it didn't combine steps from phone AND wearable. There is no way to turn off step count on the phone so if I want my ACTUAL step count from yesterday there is no way to know. I can toggle to my device in real time to see the steps but there is no way to go back days that way. I really don't understand why it would be set up this way?,3
Huawei Health,"could not download the app it suggested ""forsefully"". still not able to use it. cuz of ""the app is not available in my country"". /it has finally opened, n let me in. as if the 1st page was not popping out. now it works. n so far working as it should.",3
Huawei Health,I am very disappointed with this app..... I am using this app in my One pluse 7 pro..... App is not at all working.... In my phone with honour magic watch 2 46mm.... When I get a call from my mom.... Call get automatically lifted....by this app...... In my Redmi phone app working well only problem with in OnePlus 7 pro..... please fix this app in OnePlus..... Thanks a lot for reading this huge Report.....,1
Huawei Health,"The Huiwah health app doesn't always update my sleep records, even after restarting the band and phone. It only goes upto 79% or 83%, then says ""there is no available data."" Everything else works fine.",4
Huawei Health,"WE ALWAYS ARE NOT CONNECTED TO NETWORK ! While trecking Or hiking we may or may not get network reception , and after latest updates HEALTH IS NOT OPENING WITHOUT NETWORK RECEPTION!!! THEN WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF THIS APP IF IT NOT WORKS WITHOUT INTERNET JUST A LOCKED DUMBO!!!",3
Huawei Health,"Great way to track your exercise by day, week, month & by activity. Also good for recording your personal bests whether longest or fastest session",4
Huawei Health,"It's OK. It would be better if it did not count my bike ride as steps. Also in my profile it keeps resetting my weight and height to the incorrect settings, pointless and stupid.",3
Huawei Health,"Really enjoyed the app where my sleep monitoring is concerned as it used to break it down as deep sleep, light sleep and rem. Now for some reason the REM counter has disappeared? Also it's not recording the Naps either? Not sure what's going on? But the sooner it is resolved the better really, otherwise I'm just going to have to replace the app with something else.",3
Huawei Health,"Ugly watch faces. Please let us install 3rd party faces. And for the love of god, stop register steps on the phone! What's the point of showing what the weather is like NOW? I can take a look out my window... Make it a forecast. Even the Amazfit does that. Some improvements in watchface management! Thank you.",3
Huawei Health,Had to edit my review. Heart rate keeps defaulting back to 190 even after reinstalls. App lacks content. Time to move on from this amateur company.,1
Huawei Health,This app would be ideal if it linked to more devices particularly scales. I find it has detailed information on sleep and exercise.,4
Huawei Health,I just bought Huawei GT 2 PRO watch and I can't even synchronised it to my phone. Every time I tried to found my watch on this app it's always saying Huawei Health is not responding...🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ so I can't use my brand new watch ⌚ it's just so annoying 👍🏽,1
Huawei Health,Music support on phone is not working with Honor magic 2 watch. Need to resolve this issue asap. Watch does not control phone music and show message to open health app every 2-3 min.,2
Huawei Health,"I can not add my honor band 5, by default there is only band 3 in the device list, when I try to update device list it gives error saying that I dont have access to network.",1
Huawei Health,This is a good tool to keep fit. However it's distance measuring do no agree with wrist mounted health band of Samsung. Help me understand the differences.,4
Huawei Health,The app used to run perfectly until a couple of months. Now the app requires another app to run in the background the whole time for it to function properly. I cant even track my activities anymore without having to agree atleast 5 different permissions for various services from Huawei. I trusted the brand and this is what loyal customers like me get. i am really thinking of just bricking my huawei watch magic and buying a different brand if this issue is not solved at the earliest.,1
Huawei Health,"This app is coming only in Chinese language. I tried changing system language on phone, reinstalling this app, resetting the Honor Band5 and everything. But it's not at all coming in English. On top of that, none of the features are showing the results in the app. Sleep, activites and all are just asking to pair the device to retrieve the data even though it's already paired. And since it's not in English, it's even more difficult to understand anything. Need help here!",2
Huawei Health,It's alright. Not very intuitive. Lacks several features available even on phones today. The heart rate monitoring does not syncsync. and not able to enter manually either.,3
Huawei Health,The app is far from smooth. From nowhere my band 3E doesn't synch sleep data I tried everything I could including completely disconnecting and reconnecting. Disappointed,2
Huawei Health,Overall ap is very good. But there should be an option to customize watch faces or install third party faces in my wearable band. Watch faces are very limited.,4
Huawei Health,I was using this app from past 2 or 3 months and it is broken. After few days it stops giving me notifications on my watch. Very bad!!,1
Huawei Health,"This App doesn't work for me.Everytime I try to open the app, a message pops up saying that 'Huawei Health requires a more recent version of HMS Core (4.0.0 or later) to work work properly.You can get the latest version from the Huawei App Gallery', and exits on pressing OK. What does this even mean? I can't find it when I search in the gallery.I checked my updation history and the app is already updated.There should be more clarity on this. How do I fix this? I cannot use the my watch as well.",1
Huawei Health,"I mean please just give us the option to turn off step counting on phone and just count steps on wearable. Steps on phone are way off, phone falsely registers steps when on bike, train or driving a car. Watch does a great job, the app just makes a big mess of things after sync. Please, it's a known issue and not that big of a fix really: if then overwrite phone steps with watch steps. There, I solved it for you.",2
Huawei Health,"Login/registration is quite awkward. Need to install another app for this one to work. It asks for a lot of permissions. When launch the app it says to install it from Huawei Gallery and doesn't let you connect to the device... I can't find the Huawei Gallery app on Play Store, though. The device is pretty much useless without it. I hope they fix it.",1
Huawei Health,"This application or app for short, accurately collects my data specifically my heart rate that I can use to monitor my health on a daily basis.",5
Huawei Health,"Can't export or download .GPX files; Can't sync with no ""fit"" app neither Strava; Can't edit and share my own files. Almost useless. ""Fix"" it and you guys gonna be able to have an equal fight even against Garmin gadgets.",2
Huawei Health,Received my honour band back in may as a gift for my birthday and I love it but to use half the functions ie cycle calendar I need Huawei quick app store to use this function please fix this HUAWEI! I though this would have been updated by now and it's still the same unusable function.,1
Huawei Health,"Can you add NOTES to records? Weight and training would be improved if i can add a note. App works great, sometimes it loses info on sleep tracking, a little more info on weight training would be nice, seems to be focused on running and biking.",4
Huawei Health,Hey. My app can't connect to my smart band... Or opposite... They can pair for 2 or 3 min after that it don't work and I can't see any notification on my band... Any body can help me?,5
Huawei Health,"So many of this app's features just don't work - but the drain on the phone battery is astonishing. I think the best way to use this app is to install it once a week, sync the data, look over the data, then delete the app until next week. Needs an awful lot of work - unless it's just data mining, then it's probably working fine.",2
Huawei Health,"Keeps on saying, ""Unable to log in due to network error. Please try again later.""",1
Huawei Health,Forced to use kcal for energy rather than kj. Also seems like the tracking for calories is completely off. My fitbit easily tracked my daily calories just fine and this app seems to only track maybe 1/10th of the actual amount. Lots of improvements needed.,3
Huawei Health,"Location for weather is unnecesary. Let me choose my location on app. I don't want to enable GPS on phone the whole day. More watch faces please. Custom faces should give you more controll, I want to choose which readings is displayed.",3
Huawei Health,"The app works well but at time GPS is poor and it will draw a straight line, when you didn't.",4
Huawei Health,"Does not work. Device list can't be updated because of a ""unstable Internet connection"". Sure.",1
Huawei Health,Intuitive and simple to use. It only lacks of more stats and sleep monitoring does not always work.,4
Huawei Health,"As much as the Huawei devices are great (I love my Honor band 5), I think one great reason to refrain from buying one is this disappointing app. You can track your data, but only up to this app. There's no widget whatsoever, and I can not even sync my data to google fit despite having connected it to Huawei Health. Add a widget to display on the home screen at least please!",2
Huawei Health,"Everything about this app and my device has been spot on, 100% better than my experiences with Fitbit.. I will never return to them, I just wish I had given Huawei a looksie sooner.. I would recommend this app and wearables..",5
Huawei Health,The app isnt terrible. Its very basic but id love to be able to link my gt2 watch with a calorie counting app so it could monitor my burned calories. Or if you had one of your own thatd be even better. That would push the rating to 5* for me.,3
Huawei Health,This app is crapp. I bought the Huawei band 4 pro. waited 2 months to be delivered. I have a Samsung s9 and the app keeps telling me I have to have the latest version. I have re-instlled half a dozen times and still can't get on the app. I guess a waste of money and time. I'll stick with American brands from now on. I won't even try to get a refund.. it will be too much hassle,1
Huawei Health,For some reason this app gives you super low calories count. It makes the whole band almost useless for me. It is a very simple formula using heart rate and weight.,1
Huawei Health,Used to be the best. Destroyed by requiring a login. You should have made the login requirement if the user wants to store their history. I used to use this app to quickly check the number of steps over a period of 30 days. Used to be easy and fast. I have no use for this app now. You are going to loose your core user base with these changes.,2
Huawei Health,"App has many bugs. It sets gender, dob, height and weight by itself and you cannot update it. Plz fix this bug. It has been the issue for long and there is no fix nor any response from Huawei",1
Huawei Health,"I have one issue or Mistake, that when I click to call someone from watch then my phone screen will also open with calling screen. Please fix this issue",4
Huawei Health,Doesn't track sleep since January. The phone records sleep and few fake naps. The app started recording naps only. This is frustrating. The new update on 7/2 didn't address the issue. It is now 2 months. The app records only naps and no sleep data. I can see sleep data on watch. Contacted them twice about this issue. Deaf ears. The app has stopped tracking sleep since last update.,1
Huawei Health,Why it has not upgrade band list. My band is honor band 5 but it has not in list of its. Why this type of issue ? I buy a band and it not use than all of my money is waste on honor band 5.,2
Huawei Health,can't synchronize hear rate with Google for can't synchronize detailed training data Xiaomi has all of this ... this is a joke 1/4 price and no issue like this! shame,2
Huawei Health,Keep disconnecting and then not connecting again And there's no remote camera shutter seriously!!! Even any cheap normal smart band has remote shutter function this days.,1
Huawei Health,"The app is double counting steps by adding he information from my huawei watch and infromation from my phone. Horrible. Developers, you need to rethink this approach.",1
Huawei Health,"This program is good, but mi band program works much better than this program, for example, mi band allows access to programs and they can give more themes. Please take care. Thanks.",3
Huawei Health,"I don't understand why the app doesn't connect automatically unless the location is turned on, it should connect through Bluetooth . It's been months and this should be fixed already!",1
Huawei Health,"Horrible app experience and it's filled with bugs. Can't set my personal profile (sex, birthdate), the things I can set don't save. Can't activate dark theme. Had an option for voice prompts and set intervals, no longer can find that setting anywhere. Why would I buy an expensive watch that can't even have basic function with the app. Huawei needs to seriously fix the software experience.",1
Huawei Health,"Keeps crashing, why do these kind of apps always want acess to contacts and personal information. Just measure what we want you to measure and stop the spyware.",2
Huawei Health,Update 07/2020: The issue has been fixed after 45 days. But after multiple versions of updates. After my phone got accidentally formatted I had to reinstall the health app which was earlier working fine with my honor band 4 and now it's asking for installing Huawei Mobile Services app. Not sure why. EVEN AFTER installing it's NOT WORKING. Now my honor band is useless as the other users have commented. This is horrible guys. Fix ASAP.,4
Huawei Health,"It's a great app, but don't like that needs the GPS available all the time for weather, it should have the option of manually set the location.",4
Huawei Health,Excellent and accurate tracking app. I have connected my Honor magic 2 and it works perfectly with it. Need some latest updates.,5
Huawei Health,App have less watch faces for smartwatch which is biggest drawback. At this price other brand give larger number of watch faces. And which watch faces already there that also have very bad colours please improve watch faces for honor magic watch. And app have to lock so that notification is there which other brand dont have this. This is rediculus improve background running for app. I dont know y honor is doing parcility i have honor magic watch and they dont provid much watch faces😡😡😡,3
Huawei Health,"This app is not upto expetation. I was using smsung health sinve 3years till i purchase honor magic2 watch. Compare to it, i would say 60% only. Need motovational global chall anges into app.",1
Huawei Health,"Very flexible and wide-ranging, with stacks of data. My wife would like the option to have miles rather than kilometres, but I am fine with metric.",5
Huawei Health,"The app crashes plenty of times, and somehow the month novembre doesn't appear so I can't check any training data, of my training this month.",1
Huawei Health,I think there is an issue with hauwei gt2 software while showing weather notification.. even at night time it is showing sunny. Please solve this issue.,2
Huawei Health,"App is not bad at anything in particularly, just not very good at anything either , pointless having a app the rest of the world does not interface with ,i only use the app to compare with the samsungapp",3
Huawei Health,"It's good and works well with the honor band, but, some things could be easier to navigate",4
Huawei Health,"I have logged in to your app, however one day, my data has been lost. I tried to restore, unfirtunately I forgot my password and your app it is not helpful anymore. I forgot, so it means that I forgot, why it keeps asking me the stupid question, it seems like it will help me by asking varios questions, but you know what! I will have to answer all those stupid questions in order to restore and you know that i forgot some!! Your manual does not help me at all!!! Terrible app, terrible watch!!",1
Huawei Health,"No way to log in, the app works great, but there is no option to login! I want to update or change watch faces and it asks me to login, when i press log in nothing happens. This is annoying and there nothing i can do. I have oneplus 7 pro. I will give you 10 stars if you could help me with this issue. P.S I posted this at leas a year ago, no response, don't expect me to invest in any of your watches or smartphones, very sh*tty business plan good luck with that...",1
Huawei Health,Works fine with my honor Band 5. But it has abusive permission requirements. Why the heck you need my contacts and my phone identity??? Why we have to log in? Why we can't just use it offline?,2
Huawei Health,Hello Huawei support I am facing an issue as the app does not reconnect to the Honor watch once i restart Bluetooth or I am back within the range. Each time I need to re-pair the watch. I am using a Lenovo K8 note,3
Huawei Health,"I am a new user to this app, and I can see it is less organized compared to Samsung health, but its measurements are more accurate. Started to get used to it",4
Huawei Health,Too much security detail on an app that records your heart rate. Too many permissions and login formalities. I stopped the service on one of my phone numbers and I had to create a new account since my email address wasn't registered with them. I just want an interface for my wearable not an app that I have to put so much effort in.,1
Huawei Health,Worst App. Continues errors. No accurate data. Doesn't connecting properly to my Honor Magic 2 smartwatch. Always disconnects. Personal info (body weight/height/age and all) updated many times. It won't show. Don't sync my smartwatch data. Irritating. Always asks latest version. But no update info. Uninstalled and installation done Multiple times still same issue.,1
Huawei Health,"I am not receiving any notifications on my watch even after enabling the same in the app, restarting phone and watch and uninstalling/installing the app. Huawei? Honor? Customer support anyone??",1
Huawei Health,A good and intuitive app that gives you a better idea of how to improve you habits and how to achieve your personal goals but there is one key point missing. I would like to be able to introduce my food so at the end of the day to know if I am on the right path. I used to have a Garmin traker that has his own garmin connect app that works very well with the calorie counter myfitnesspall app. On the latest update watch faces dissappear and we cannot find them for Watch gt 2,3
Huawei Health,"Something is wrong with heart rate detection during workout, after some randomly minutes, heart rate alwyas drop to under 80, and i'm not even in warm up zone while my training is on.",1
Huawei Health,"Hi Team, After update, outdoor cycle workout option was removed in the device. You have removed and made it available only in app. This makes sense as anyway earlier we had to open app as well to start this workout. However, the cycling workout didn't capture my workout correctly. I have never had any issue before. It just started only after update.",1
Huawei Health,"The profile info will not save. Every time I open the app, I have to change the height n weight. It defaults to 13ft and 90lbs... Smh frustrating.",1
Huawei Health,Honor band 5 is not showing in App despite several attempts to Add device in Smart Band. Only honor 3 is shown and on selecting same when trying to pair with Honor Band 5 it does not.,1
Huawei Health,"Lot of improuvement must be done, it's way far from samsung health app, wake up!! Music management on watch, weather forecast, and lot more",1
Huawei Health,Impove the step count system. As i m using honor magic watch 2 connected with huawei health app. Now the step count in app n watch is clubbed. Which is to be fixed.,3
Huawei Health,Recently I upgraded the firmware of watch and the calling feature stopped working. Product deployed without testing. Fix it ASAP.,1
Huawei Health,"I use this for my GT 2 watch, I had issues with things not synching from watch to my phone. Uninstall the reinstalled and working well now.",3
Huawei Health,"has a few issues with my experience : 1. always needs gps switched on to connect to a deivce 2. honor band 5 has issues in changing faces 3. the device gets disconnected when I switch off my gps after connecting with the paired device 4. poorly calibrated imu for movement gesture based menu change 5. water (35ppm clean water) when it comes in contact with the touch button part, screen lights up for no reason 6. after a volume of messages, rate of response and the delay in spo2 and bmp changes. and a lot more that I just am not into typing out much good piece of hardware, even I as a developer could have done better job to manage this project. Probably even a first year college kid who is a decent developer could have done a better , smoother job. Anyway, Thats all folks.",2
Huawei Health,"Installed on Note 3, it functioned for about 3 minutes then the app closed as with every subsequent opening of the app. This is useless and, to me as a pensioner, an expensive waste of money having bought a Huawei health band that I'm now unable to use at all. It eventually began working on another phone only fail again. Additionally, it rarely connected to the app without messing about, unlike the xaomi band/app I had previously. This HUAWEI and HEALTH APP is an APALLING combination!",1
Huawei Health,The watch is good and very clean interface. But there are very limited watch faces available. They need to update the watch faces and need to increase them.,4
Huawei Health,"It stops recording run the moment you stand still. If there is a setting to disable this, it is obscurely hidden. Unusable for running, unfortunately.",2
Huawei Health,"Great when it works! Records HR on my honor magic and the workout but app doesn't always sync. It's paired, latest version, etc. I got some huawei background update a few days ago and it's probably bugged this app. A bit of a joke. Two hours of workout showing on my watch and app shows steps but no activity for today yet syncs the HR records for the same workout! I've cleared cache, firmware reset etc. A joke. Going back to Garmin. Buy cheap and you get a sporadic experience!",1
Huawei Health,Workouts & heart rates still don't sync with Google fit. No overview panel for daily steps. Can't change goal. No weekly progress. Sleep can't sync with Google fit.,1
Huawei Health,So far good. The sync is a little slower than anticipated but overall I pleased so far.,4
Huawei Health,Absolutely stupid App. Won't work untill it tests your technical capabilities in downloading another app not from the Google play store and make it run in the background. This made my experience of buying a new magic watch disappointing. This is my first experience with anything related to huawei. It has been unexpectedly disappointing to say the least. And what's even more disappointing is these tons of reviewers that aren't happy with this app recently and still huawei can't or won't fix it,1
Huawei Health,"This doesn't work alone, tells you to download other apps for this to work. Took a while to download all the other apps associated to running just this one. When I'm on it, the very basic stuff is in English and everything else is in mandarin, no idea how to change settings in app or if it's even possible.",1
Huawei Health,"***UPDATE*** 19/7/20 I have updated this review from one star. This problem below is now fixed. Rating improved and thanks for fixing! ____ All of a sudden it won't work and wants me to install Huawei Mobile Services 4.0 which is unavailable in the Play Store (only version 3.xxx available) and according to several reports is loaded with all kinds of dodgy privacy permissions even if it was available. My new watch is now a brick. Thanks Huawei, wish you just stuck to Android Wear.",4
Huawei Health,"I love my GT2E as a smartwatch. It does everything I want it to. However, I'm going to have to return it because this app (which is necessary to use the watch) sucks so much. The screen to enter height, weight, age, and sex is so buggy that it doesn't work at all. The app resets me height to 16 feet 4 inches, my weight to 88 pounds, and will not allow me to set a sex or age. Plus, there's no integration with Google Fit. Fix these and I'll keep the watch. It's running on my Mi 9T Pro.",1
Huawei Health,"Overall I WAS satisfied with the features even with some minor glitches. However, now I see that sleep data is not properly synchronised. I only have Deep sleep, light sleep and wakeup. I do not have REM anymore and the percentage analysis previously shown is not displayed either. Sometime the sleep data is shown on the device but not synchronised properly and it only shows few minutes/hours of nap.",3
Huawei Health,"What's happened, used to connect 100% with honor band 5, now disconnected multiple times per day, won't sync health data. Tried latest app update and band 5 firmware. Followed advice and cleared cache and re installed both apps not a single improvement. Fitness tracker is now only good as a timepiece. Contacted Huawei online and heard nothing. Very disappointed.",1
Huawei Health,Problems Syncing Sleep Data Im having problems with syncing sleep data. Last one was new years eve. Its obviously a glitch going into 2020. Very annoying. Please fix asap. June 2020 update. Its even more useless than normal. Not syncing sleep data from wrist band to phone app. The app seems totally useless. The only thing its any good for is a step counter. Other than that. Dont bother. Ill save for a fit bit.,4
Huawei Health,Started off great. Now it's s***. Doesn't track your GPS whatsoever since the last update. Any runners out there know how frustrating it is when you've pushed yourself on a run only to find out the app hasn't tracked your GPS the entire run and no record of your time or proper distance anywhere. This keeps occurring.,1
Huawei Health,"I have HW2 and for the past few years used Google Fit to track my fitness. I decided to try Huawei Health app and see how it stacks up against Google especially because it has Integration with Googe Fit. The app itself if working alright and provides additional details based on my heartbeat. What is really disappointing is integration with Google Fit. It looks like it is completely absent even when I linked the accounts. Also, no cloud storage for workouts, change your phone, workouts are gone.",3
Huawei Health,"I now own a Huawei Smart Band 3 Pro and Huawei scales, and I'm quite impressed with what I got for my money. Some queries : *Sometimes it double counts my steps, or sometimes it displays them correctly but doubles them in Google Fit. *I wish it would send my heart rate data to Google Fit: the cheaper Mi Band can do this. If the steps issues were resolved, and if there was connectivity to food apps, I'd use this as a replacement for Google Fit. Until then, I rely on the Google Fit support.",4
Huawei Health,Overall good. But for music uploading there must have some more paths. Otherwise all other is good functional.,4
Huawei Health,"If you would like to share data from and to other apps, forget the Huwei watches, get you something else. Even Google Fit that it seems to connect with, it won't pull exercise data from it, you have to trigger the Huawei Health to record your exercise separately. Sleep just got an update that is better than before. Hope to see Pixel Watch soon",1
Huawei Health,Could not update device list check your network. Keep getting. Just purchased gt2e watch and can't even pair it with my android. Fix this,1
Huawei Health,"I bought the Huawei honor band 5. Followed the steps but when I tried to add device, it's not in the list and says device not supported. Poor, poor, poor.",1
Huawei Health,The app stops syncing with the watch too often and needs to be manually synced again to continue receiving phone notifications on the watch.,2
Huawei Health,workout cycling doesn't have speed km/hour after update in cycling. but the firmware before is good. please fix that. thanks,4
Huawei Health,Easy to interface with good battery life. Certainly helps me to keep active especially during lockdown.,5
Huawei Health,Having a food intake tool in the app like s health would be amazing. Other things like leadership board would be nice too Only thing stopping me from using it as my main fitness app,3
Huawei Health,I'm trying to reset my password for a month now and I can't.. stupid app.. while asking for help it just says use the browser you use the most (only)..what a smart app,1
Huawei Health,Keeps aksing to enable cloud sync which I don't want to be on. Annoying to the point that i came here to leave 1 star rating.,1
Huawei Health,Fails to install on an Honor 7X running Android 9. What a joke of an app! I bought an Honor Band 5 and I can't use it with my phone.,1
Huawei Health,"People you need to erese cash of all Huawei apps (healt, HMS and app gallery). Reset your watch to factory settings and then install apps again (first app gallery, HMS and then healt app). But DON'T login with old account, make new one and turn on airplane mode after install healt app and then open it, choose your region and follow instruction, then turn off airplane mode. After those steps it all works on my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 8)🤬",1
Huawei Health,"Very good app . I have one suggetion : In sleep analysis section, Please add heart rate data with corrsponding sleep sleep pattern(e.g Deep, REM, Light ). Both graphs (Sleep and Heart) should be displayed on the same page .It would be good value addition. Please add facility to store SPO2 data from ..It is more important feature now in this covid time to keep a track of SpO2 Overall good app. Thanks",4
Huawei Health,Does not sync workouts and I keep getting a message saying the app has stopped working. Also seems to drain my battery really fast. What is the point of the watch without a decent app to support it? No efforts fròm Huawei to communicate and advise on planned fixes. We are just left in the dark....,1
Huawei Health,This app is not working Got my brand new band 4 pro just out of the box. I was looking forward to using it but the app wont work. It tells me to download the latest version 4.0 which I have done and still cant even open the app for the very first time. Terrible from a company that I really respected.,1
Huawei Health,Relatively good app with some terrible problems. First and foremost the app simply cannot connect if the wifi is turned on. Can only connect via mobile network. There is no option to setup scheduled spo2 measuring which is pitty. Automatic data synchronisation to google fit not working. No options for scheduled synchronisation.,1
Huawei Health,"I am not able to use the app. It automatically log me out every time. I have tried like 100 times. Every time it ask to download the updated version, where in I am downloading the same. It is just ridiculous. I have complained about the same to company 100 times. Still the same. I am going to return the watch now. I am done.",1
Huawei Health,This app is good but it has so many bug. In my phone sometimes it's lagging and some option does not support in my phone. I also can not my honor band 5-0 FA properly......,3
Huawei Health,"1.Good,But in this app there is no option to put custom faces as our like.There is no proper tracker for cycling.why there is no automatic cycling tracker. _ 2.To use Cycle Calender ""Install the latest version of HMS Core (version 4.0.0 or later) to use this feature. After it's installed, log out of your HUAWEI ID, then log back in and try again. Get the latest version in AppGallery."" _ 3.How much apps we want to download to use this watch.Is not easy. _ 4.Why you are not solving these issues...",2
Huawei Health,"Not great, I bought a huawei watch that links to the app which has ended up as an expensive pedometer, not something that syncs up with the app and provides me with reports or tracking. Been using it for a month now and still have no daily or weekly reports available despite syncing every evening, very poor and un installing the app, will keep using the watch as a digital step counter as that's all it seems able to do",1
Huawei Health,"I bought a band to track my fitness data accurately. The only way to store and view my data in detail is by using the Huawei Health App( the worst app) and the app uses phone as step counter along with band & shows phone movement as step. If I wanted my phone to count steps , I wouldn't need to buy the band. Simply having the option to disable the phone as a step Counter would fix this. THE WORST APP",1
Huawei Health,"Everything is okay, but there is one nice feature that could be added. It would be awesome to have water intake calculator/water reminder both in app and on watch.",5
Huawei Health,"App stopped connecting and I had to forget all my Bluetooth devices to reconnect it. Also my profile clearly says female, but all my suggested info compares me to my male peers. It would be really great if it actually synced with Google fit but it doesn't. Also more of a watch problem but maybe something isn't going right with updates but training status has always been misspelled. Without these many minor and frustrating annoyances it is mostly good.",3
Huawei Health,"I own a Xiaomi Mi Note 10 smartphone and just bought a Huawei Honor Band 5 watch. My partner has the same identical watch as me but she owns a Huawei Mate 20 Pro. In the Huawei Health app she's able to view the route of a walk in Google Maps. I don't have this 'Route' option displayed at all. Tried reinstalling the app, granting full permissions, rebooting but it just doesn't show up. My GPS is on and I have Google Maps installed ony phone. How come one phone has it but the other does not?",1
Huawei Health,"Sucky, sucky, 5 dollars... Get some help creating apps that dont ask for newer hms ram versions , whatever that might be?!?!, from a gallery app that cant be downloaded on an android phone... I would like to keep my NEW WATCH GT 2 but if its going to be a pain in the ass im going back to wear os, which is easy to use and fast/quick install. Its not a great feeling coming home with a new watch that is totally useless...fix it.",1
Huawei Health,Pathetic experience till now. Even after installing huaweii mobile services the cloud login is not coming up to backup data. Moreover the watch faces show up when the device is not connected but goes away from screen when device is connected. I am using Honor band 5 though. My app version is 10.1.0.311.,2
Huawei Health,Loved the app when paired with my WatchGT. Just wish I could change watch faces. Lots of features and great interface. Best health app around.,4
Huawei Health,"My vivo y51 cannot open this application.. Even it's say min operating system is android 4.4 in the smartwhatch manual, mine is 5.0.. Please give me the solution for this issue..",1
Huawei Health,App not working on miui 12 update. And the fit band is not syncing properly and the weather is not syncing at all. Update your software and fix the BUGS... DAMNIT,1
Huawei Health,Unable to change my weight & height in my profile... Keeps reverting back to 14ft tall !!! & 86lb !!!! Making this app useless ! APP NEEDS UPDATING SO THESE FUNCTIONS WORK kcals & distance calculations are WRONG based on height & weight,1
Huawei Health,"Sleep data is not syncing. It sometimes appears after a couple of days, which is useless, but more often than not it doesn't appear at all.",1
Huawei Health,"I haee problem Is not possible to chage the source of the step only Huawei gt2. If I wanted my phone to count steps, I wouldn't need to buy the watch. Not being able to disable the phone as a step Counter source. The phone picks up hundreds more steps than the watch. I wear my band all day specifically to track my fitness. Simply having the option to disable the phone as a step Counter source would fix this entirely.",2
Huawei Health,After having to reinstall the App (several times) after updates to get the sleep monitor function working on my wristband now the App crashes when trying to view the sleep data from my wristband which defeats the purpose of the App ... if it can't do the basic functions required what'sthe point.... Pathetic .....,1
Huawei Health,"This app forced me to create account on huawei.. So i created account and synced data in the morning, but due to some reason i uninstalled app temporarily, And in evening when i re installed this app, there is no option to login, register or logout. Now i feel a bit concerned about my privacy after this incident. Too shady app.",1
Huawei Health,I am using honour magic watch2. The watch is Perfect and the reading of every workout is very good. But when coming to the app there is a huge problem because the app is combining the step count of phone and watch both so my data is getting double which is not good so if i wear the watch 24 hour then what is the need of getting data from phone . Actually the phone's step count contaminating my real data and history. Today i woke up and the app is displaying my step count 53641 horrible. Fix it.,1
Huawei Health,"Can't change my height it will default back to 14ft no matter what, sometimes if I enter 1ft it will change to 3ft though, a little bit closer... Also step counter useless because can't disable phone as data source, laughable!",1
Huawei Health,"Not much issues with app. But the music controller isn't working on Honor Band 5. When I press volume up, it lowers the volume down of the music.(keeping health app in background with a very stable bluetooth connection.) I expected a update but till now it hasn't come. Please look forward to this issue.",3
Huawei Health,"Great app for the sportwatch - however you cannot export your own exercise data into any popular data type (.CVS, .GPX, .KLM)",3
Huawei Health,"There is a very big problem in honor gs pro smartwatch, when we call via watch to favourite number call goes to any wrong number.please fix this problem.",1
Huawei Health,Does not share heart rate with google fit. The interval training training courses do not notify the runner about the intervals via the band.,1
Huawei Health,"Using android phone, step count is added from both mobile app an watch. Wrong design. User should have option to choose source of taking steps count like from app or watch.",1
Huawei Health,All YouTube videos talk about a large watch face library in the app for the fit... I do not even have watch faces in the app at all... I'm using a brand new fit watch and the latest app and firmware... Very disapointing,1
Huawei Health,"Amazing Huawei Health App pairs with GT2 Pro smartwatch. Unfortunately, it can't sync with other Health App such as Strava.. Looking forward for Huawei Health improvement soon",5
Huawei Health,This is the worst app I have ever used!! I am unable to set my date of birth/ sex/ height or weight. Uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times. Spent 30 minutes on the phone with huawei customer service to no avail. I bought a Huawei gt 2 watch and it was delivered a day ago... beautiful watch useless app. I guess u need a huawei phone for this to be useful. Needless to say I will be returning the watch and find something else. Too bad the watch had awesome battery life.,1
Huawei Health,So I can't change any of the personal information on the app. It says I'm 14 feet 10 inches tall and I weigh 120 pounds. I can't change gender or birthday either... So how do you track accurate progress in your workouts? There's also no way to access the watch face store. This app is a disaster... Makes the watch moot. Will probably return the watch itself just because the app is so terrible.,1
Huawei Health,"No HR data export support, and other data only to Google or Strava. Age and gender can not be updated, and always crashes when trying to open hr settings. For some reason it counts steps using both the phone and the watch. Unfortunately there is no alternative software that works with the device",1
Huawei Health,the app has no configuration option. To browse the watch faces takes hours... look at the garmin app as a good example. The app works with the gt2 watch. This watch cannot be qualified as Sport watch because nothing is configurable. Workout files cannot be downloaded or shared. Gpx format is not supported.The watch has a very long life time. Even with gps. But it seems that when you are using the GPS to record a car trip then the speed measurements and the location measurements are not accurate,1
Huawei Health,"Hi, I live in Iran. I bought a g2 watch and installed the health program. I did the things you said to show Watch faces, but this option is not displayed. Watch faces can't be displayed for me, I also changed the internet, that's why it's difficult, I'm tired .Please solve this problem. I will have to sell the watch. This is a problem for many people. Why is this?",1
Huawei Health,"The app is terribly unreliable. And the worst thing is that there is no support at all. Even here, look, you never reply to any review. If I haven't spent so much money on the honor watch i would already stop using it. My goal was 10000 steps 100 days in a row. In a month of my challenge your app lost a half of the steps day data from the watch. And it happened again in 2 months! My watch counted 10000 steps while the stupid app only 9960. I hope my watch will break soon to buy smth different.",1
Huawei Health,The app is in chinese for me making it unusable. I have the honour band 5 which is great but without the app it is useless. I've searched on the app many times for a way to change the language to english and it seems to just not be there. I contacted the app developers asking if there was a way to change the language and they just didn't reply. Dont buy Huawei gear as they're all unusable without an app to accompany them,1
Huawei Health,I cannot customiz my watch faces. And asking me to log in continuosly when i try to install a new watch face. Good news is this app started working again but somtimes still doesnt work and will require to downlord a latest version. Overall very unhappy of this app and i am so disappointed for buying a huwaei band for my Samsung device.,2
Huawei Health,Awful bug with the step count... It is absolutely incomprehensible why huawei don't resolve the issue. Happens every time when I use activity on the watch.,1
Huawei Health,"Update 8/3/2020: Please fix the profile BUG! 7/30/2020: Very ANGRY, 生气! What happened to Huawei Health? Are you hearing these complaints?!!! Update 7/26/2020: Extremely disappointed! This app still has a major defect and Huawei makes no immediate effort to fix it! Check the PROFILE fields, these errors make all calculations WRONG! 7/23/2020: Damn it, the profile errors are NOT FIXED! SHAME on you! Does Huawei have genuine programmers?",1
Huawei Health,"This app falls short because you cannot view your exercise routes on the satilite image. When running or biking in the country, far from roads, your route is just a line on a blank page with no references. If it could be viewed on the satellite image that would be perfect.",3
Huawei Health,"I'm facing a problem in my watch gt2e after auto detection from the watch for walking and enabling it manually, even the battery level was 48% the watch after few minutes automatically power off. By which I cannot use the watch for anything else as it off. But after reaching home and placing it in the charger it pop ups the logo of huwaei and show the battery of same 48%...",3
Huawei Health,"I bought Huawei GT2 e Watch yesterday, everything is working fine but I am not getting WhatsApp call notification and Instagram notification, I have done all necessary notification settings but problem hasn't resolved .",1
Huawei Health,"Its a good app with easy interface there's only lack of two things which they should take into consideration ,adding a hydration tracker and updating the app to make it work offline",4
Huawei Health,Firstly it was doing good but since I have updated the band and the app.. My phone keeps on vibrating unnecessarily and the band doesn't even show the call notifications. Second thing is when u forget the password the app keep on asking stupid questions like type your old password .. N if I would have knew my older password thn why would I opt for the option forgot password. This app is a mess.That vibration thing is super annoying. Not happy. 🙁,2
Huawei Health,"After the new update, I lost nearly 10 months of data of exercise, weight and steps! Why!? On top of that, the timer for high intensity workout is not working in the new update. I can't even edit gender and DOB. Though now it syncing sleep data properly.",2
Huawei Health,There is one comment when I used the cycling the calories account by the distance not by the heart rate. That means when I drive for 2 hours the app account 370 calories because i drive 20km But when I drive cycle for 30km in 1 hour the app account 850 calories,3
Huawei Health,Huawei Health requires a more recent version of HMS Core (4.0.0 or later) to work properly. You can get the latest version in HUAWEI AppGallery. This is what I get when I try to open the app. And it is the latest version in Google Play.,3
Huawei Health,"Reasonable app but lack of ability to interact with other fitness tracking app is a downside, even struggles to sync with Google Fit.",4
Huawei Health,"I have honor 9lite previously, but after switching to samsung my all previously app data is wipe up... how to restore, there is no sign in button in samsung health app.",4
Huawei Health,"I have used other smart watches but none are as accurate and detailed as the Huawei Smart Watch GT 2.The screen display is gorgeous, many sport applications and easy to operate. ￼",5
Huawei Health,"Step counter is not matched with band. also not same as dashboard card and inner chart page, yes but when u reinstall app, it's show right. Check it",3
Huawei Health,"I had same problem when I got a new phone. The up date would work. I tried everything thing & gave up months ago. Today iv managed to set it up. I typed in old version, took a wile to set it back up, started all over again. It has just found my old history.",3
Huawei Health,"We need an upgrade like viewing sticker chat on this device, also more features for workout, bringing detection of repetition for weightlifting will be such a good upgrade for this device.",2
Huawei Health,"So far it seems ok, though i have only been useing it for a few days now. What i dont like so far is that i can NOT set up my profile. I can NOT pick a gender, bith date, and when i try to set my weight and height, is will NOT save. Other wise it has been ok so far. I would maybe give it more stars if i could set my profile and change the time to refelct non military time and spend more time useing the app with the Hero 5 band.",3
Huawei Health,"Very poor performance, not accurate, is there any other alternate app for this honor band 5? 1> All ways getting disconnect issues. 2> unable to enter details in profile. 3> sp02 reading will be very difficult always prompt for Wear the band tightly... Even thought it is almost and completely tight... 4> over all not stable app..",1
Huawei Health,"I bought the Honor Band 5 recently and installed this app. In the profile settings, the app doesn't allow to update the DOB and gender. The app doesn't respond. I can update height and weight though. I tried re-installing.but it still doesn't work. I am using Asus Zenfone 5. I tried this app on a mi redmi device. It doesn't work.",3
Huawei Health,The same notification is being displayed multiple times (most of the time twice) on my GT 2 sport. There are posts older than 6 months where people complain about this and it's still not fixed,1
Huawei Health,Update: the geniuses at Huawei apparently can't make an app that connects to a watch now. Got a new phone and the new app doesn't work in the US. Absolutely terrible experience. Don't waste your money,1
Huawei Health,The App does not support Huawei B2 band. This is a problem because the Huawei App directs to Health app for you data but the B2 device wont pair. Its a major problem to be addressed.,1
Huawei Health,"Not great. Have moved from fitbit and this app is not nearly as good. Resting heart rate often does not calculate and is so volatile, even on a daily basis that it cannot be accurate. Gives my fitness score based on a female even though I've set my profile as a male. Syncs very well and it's easy to use.",2
Huawei Health,Same problems as Andrey and Jamie. Gallery app not compatible with my phone. Customer service had me download Spanish version in order to install mobile services app. Both required security settings and new logins so I cancelled. I will most likely return the G2 watch and find something that works.,1
Huawei Health,Updating review from 3 to 1 star. Even with the newer update unable to use the app. Why should an app need other app requirement for it to function!!!! New update is not allowing the application to launch. It shows a error about requiring a newer version about huawei mobile services.,3
Huawei Health,Worst health app...mostly information in chinese language. Combimed counts step of mobile as well as smartwatch....no option for smartwatch only...most of the time it does not send notification to the smartwatch. Same prroblem in caller ID. You will have to install two additonal app for installing latest Huawei Health app. So please dont go for it...its useless...,1
Huawei Health,"App used to track my cycling journeys, it crashed on me every time (mid journey). Very disappointed.",1
Huawei Health,"Great app, that gives very good features, such as training programs and health monitoring",5
Huawei Health,4 start is almost perfect =) additional one start to make you excellent is reserved so that you can still have more great updates and additional option for us.. thank you and keep it up =),4
Huawei Health,"You are able to easily keep track of you steps, sleep pattern and stress with ease. Also you can keep check of your wait too. It also will send notifications from your phone to your Huawei watch.",4
Huawei Health,"Worked fine for a month but now it won't open at all on my Samsung. I deleted the cache and data, have reinstalled the app but still isn't working. Just says there was an error logging in and then closes. It's got the latest update so not sure where to go from here!!",2
Huawei Health,"Worst app I've been using dis app since 2018 along with Honor band A2 on my Nokia 6. D app and d band both r inaccurate, 4 accuracy, i use Sports Tracker, which is way better nd provides accurate results everytime even without any wearable attached. After latest update d app has started crashing nd loosing d data during activities. I was looking to purcahse a new device 4 me and my dad, I think i have 2 ignore chinese products, dey only increase quantity rather den quality of d product.",1
Huawei Health,"Extremely disappointed !!!... after the update, app is not even opening properly..making the honor band5 useless as a smart band... no fitness tracking, or phone notifications possible as the huawei health app is behaving strange..band is not even connected to the phone post update.. please find a solution as soon as possible.",1
Huawei Health,"Its nice app with lots of fitness tracking details and functions but why is it not available in ""English"" it makes it hard to use and understand as many of the things in the app are in ""Mandarin"", please make it available in English in countries other than ""China""",1
Huawei Health,"The watch is cute. However, a little disappointed that I can't download more watch faces since it's not available in the US. I probably would have stuck with the Xiaomi band pro 5 had I known this.",3
Huawei Health,"Using since last 3 years. Fantastic app. You can choose sessions what you need in walking, cycling, marathon running etc with GPS.👍",5
Huawei Health,"Updates have made my honor band 4 useless, it just shows the time. Negative star wud be a better rating because After 3rd app update is not syncing with the band at all, and is disconnecting with the band repetitively, no notifications are coming on the band. Even reviews are not helping, developers are not providing any reply/solution to my problem",1
Huawei Health,The health app has some bugs: - Female and male is switched in the VO2 running report for my device. My profile says male and the VO2 reports says performance very good among female peers. When I switch my profile gender to female the VO2 report is now saying male. Also suggesting some improvements : - Please add option to add more than one smart alarm as I need different timings for weekdays and weekends. - Add constant SpO2 monitoring during workouts for Huawei band pro 4.,3
Huawei Health,The app sucks.. I can't even update my basic profile information which includes age and sex. What gets updated is again set back to a default value once I exit from the app.. Please huawei do look into the issue as the honor magic watch 2 is fantastic for the specs it offers but at the same time software should also be upto the mark. Please bring in the update.,1
Huawei Health,"App contains only walk, run and bike activities. I can't sync with linked Google fit account. No heart rates, no sleep data",2
Huawei Health,its been 2 weeks using this aap and honor band 5 . both worked so well and the data is real time 100% accurate . it deserves 5 star,5
Huawei Health,This app combined with my Huawei watch has really motivated me. Each run or walk I do is mapped and I strive to run further each day.,5
Huawei Health,Got a new gt 2 pro watch as a gift. Trying to pair it up with this stupid app. Every time I try it is saying app not responding. My phone is freezing. This app is garbage. Looks like waste of money. Please do your research before you buy anything. Won't recommend at all,1
Huawei Health,"The app prevent my phone to go automatically sleep. It make the screen to keep turned on and never turned off, it drains the battery! I DEMAND A FIX!",1
Huawei Health,Absolute garbage at recording the distance of your workouts - it's let me down too many times. Time to switch!,1
Huawei Health,It is a amazing app for tracking my device and it doesn't disconnect when I charge my device like in other bands like M4 it gets disconnect very soon,5
Huawei Health,"After updating the app to the latest version, my honor band 5 doesn't connect to app like it used to be. I have to literally do unpair-pair the device to get my band connected EVERY TIME the Bluetooth get disconnected when I move too away from my phone with my band. Please fix this regression",1
Huawei Health,Useless health app which is not opening without internet access? Is login to your online system is more important than accessing the application? R u spying? Lot more to improve: 1 Device auto connect needed. It's irritating to reconnect time to time. 2 SpO2 monitor to add auto mode by time frequency 3 Device sync is trouble getting SpO2 data of 2-3 hrs 4 Option needed in application to check heart rate & SpO2 manually from application itself 5 Health data widget most important thing missing.,1
Huawei Health,"Update Issue Resolved For those who were facing the update issue for version 4.0.0, I found the solution. Uninstall the Health App and the Huawei App. Then download the Huawei App first and then the Health App. It will ask you to log in again and voila it starts working. Issue resolved after 3 months.",5
Huawei Health,"You can't enter any profile information. The sex and birthday isn't clickable, and the weight and height doesn't even save correctly. So without this app the band is useless. Fantastic what a waste of money. Huawei what are you doing? You used to be good. I guess back to my trusty samsung watch.",1
Huawei Health,Why do I need another app to use this one? And why am I still locked out of the app inspite of downloading the other linked app? And why has this issue not been solved yet? The app worked perfectly until two months ago. This is frustrating.,1
Huawei Health,"When I first got the GT watch I could control music fine. One update later it required me to have this app open to control music (why?). Two updates later the app keeps closing randomly and I have keep re-opening the app. So frustrating. There's no need, it's just basic Bluetooth controls.",2
Huawei Health,"The app showed option for log in last month. As I changed my mobile, the app now showing no option to login again!",1
Huawei Health,"I updated to a new phone, and now this app is asking to log in or create an account. Why? to steal data! Earlier it was not.",2
Huawei Health,"Love my band, hate this app! The GPS tracking is fine however it does not accurately count my steps or my calorie burn since it does not allow you to set your height, weight, gender. This seems like such a simple fix! I am shocked this company has yet to fix this app!",1
Huawei Health,"I was start exercise, but when i use the exercise on this app, they dont show what to do in the app, so i think developer can add feature to it for better experience",4
Huawei Health,"Pretty useless app, won't retain height/weight, defaults back to 14' 10"" height and 80lb weight, only managed to sync sleep details twice,",1
Huawei Health,Its a pretty amazing app though..I am very impressed👏👏..I started using this app when I bought the Huawei smart fit..Its easy and simple to use..,5
Huawei Health,"When selecting apps for watch notifications, if two apps have the same name, only one is listed /selectable. So, if Samsung Messages is installed and you use Google Messages, as both apps are called ""Messages"", only the first (Samsung) can be selected for notifications",2
Huawei Health,"Passable for simple tasks (steps #, heart rate) but the algorithms are buggy as hell. I am 1.78m tall, and it thinks my step length is over 1m. Sleep data is hit and miss as well: reading in bed is nearly always recorded as sleeping (and shows REM and deep sleep phases as well - lol).",3
Huawei Health,"It's ok, but there's lots of little irritations. I can't disable my phone as a source of step counting. That's the most frustrating.",3
Huawei Health,"Finally got the info to be able to download the required update. Well worth Googling how to connect a Huawei band to an Android device, the info worked, the full app is now installed. The only down side is the new part is predominantly in Chinese. Use Google translate to covert to your language, I may learn some Chinese.",3
Huawei Health,"It does not conect my honor band 5 without gps on... you must to have on the bluetooth and gps together for a connection with the app. That's drains my mobile batery. Please just bluetooth should be enough for simple connection. If the person goes to walk on the street is fine put the gps on, however gps on for what? Fix that. Regards",3
Huawei Health,"Please set NEW watchface in upper list, so i can notice if new watchface release, & fix the apps not continuously track my gps phone when cycling so my route messed up ( i use honor band5 )",1
Huawei Health,"Useful, especially for exercise and sleep patterns tracking. Now using the Huawei Fit on an A30 Samsung Galaxy. A feature to this software would be of value is: After one has slept for a selected period an alarm is sounded. For example, like taking a nap during the day for 1 hour only. Thanks",5
Huawei Health,Sending bug reports via e-mail has never resulted in any response and the last update was 15 July 2020. I don't think they're still developing/supporting the app.,2
Huawei Health,It needs easier and to alarms so I don't have to navigate my phone so much right before bed. It wanted me to agree to time of data tracking in order to use the app. The app should work fine without this so it's frustrating it's not a choice since I can't use my fitness band without this app.,2
Huawei Health,Since I changed my phone I have step counting from space. I don't know what to do. Watch shows 10000 but on display in the app I have 67000 !!! ?????? I only want data to be used from watch but I can not set it like this. I lost 3 months of exercise !!!! I don't know if I can use this app to track fitness activities anymore.,1
Huawei Health,First time app connected with my smart band. Later it doesn't not connected even the band restarted and device Bluetooth off and on.,1
Huawei Health,Some more Watch faces would be great although the selection is decent but New ones every week or so would be brilliant.,5
Huawei Health,"Stuck in Japanese or Chinese. Can't read anything, no way of changing language. Note 10+",1
Huawei Health,The app is very badly designed. Some options do not work the heart beat does not show on app. Very disappointing.,1
Huawei Health,"Network error whenever I start the app without internet connection? Why do I need internet to use it and connect to my Honor band? Very frustrating when I want to use it in a place without internet like plane, ship, remote island and just simply no internet.",2
Huawei Health,Ones again issues doesn't solved. This is a showing technical support failed by Huawei's. Same error still not solved. It is shameful. Again no improvement. improvement of this update. getting same error. After update this version app doesn't open getting error requires ver 4.0 or later kindly fix bug asap.,1
Huawei Health,Steps always said more than I'd actually walked. But had to restart or do a restore a couple of times and now after restore it wont work screen says download app which i have already. So uninstall and reinstall it still saying download app. Cant get it to work so im going to Samsung instead.,2
Huawei Health,Android version of this app is not good ass compared to ios...it is not getting connected automatically and always seeking the location on..hey huawei plz fix this problem,5
Huawei Health,"Well I don't know how but everything works until few days it's stop sync data from my watch to this app: running, sleep, only heart rate work correctly. I restart both my watch and health app I just delete my all data and start again. But now I can't install watch theme that I want. I'm very disappointed!",1
Huawei Health,Not very useful...cycling data is very inaccurate...speed distance covered all data is different from standard data,2
Huawei Health,"Good app, good sleep tracker ...but....for some reason when I use the workout and other and lift weights, my heart rate never , ever , ever ,ever goes over 129....I mean I can be near stroke , heart in my ears pounding...blurry vision...look at app....128...127...123 and drops from there...I realize it's not 100% but I know I'm waaay over 129...I have reset it and clear cache , I have cleared everything and started fresh...same thing ...so I had Fit and it logs my HR at 159 to 168 sometimes ...",5
Huawei Health,"The features are good, UI is good, other things are also good... But the app is sooooo slow it literally takes more time to load or switch this app than it takes to boot my computer... Switching between my music app and health is also slow.... And this app crashes randomly causing loss of exercise...",1
Huawei Health,"This app is decent but much better. For example: When trying to add a workout record for my Huawei Watch G2, I am limited to only 5 or 6 workouts to choose from, although the list of exercises/activities available on the watch is extensive.",3
Huawei Health,Specific workout tracking . Make a workout plan and get started with this amazing app. Helps to achieve your goals.,4
Huawei Health,Will not open. Unable to log in due to network error is constantly displayed. Just brought the Band 3 Pro and cannot use it. App developer is not responding to my emails. Steer clear and just pay more for a better brand.,1
Huawei Health,Its not updating the device list. I am not able to pair my watch as its not available in the devices. Why would they launch such half baked app. Returning my watch. Poor experience,1
Huawei Health,"A good app turned into disaster after last few updates. It is asking for login id which it never asked before. I don't remember that. And when I am choosing forget password, it hangs every time. So no way to get into in now.",1
Huawei Health,The app is not connecting the watch and when I select the device it show updates and it is freezing at 11% ..cannot use the app .,1
Huawei Health,I'm using latest version on realme 7 pro. It doesn't pair my Honor band 5. Always prompts device not supported.,1
Huawei Health,No Band 4 support? why is that? I allways get an error when updating device list. why?,1
Huawei Health,I have 3 points 1. When I use Huawei smart scale I found a difference in the body fat percentage mean while when I step on the scale I found a value then I went down and try again the same minute I found another value for the body fat percentage!! Actually this makes make crazy 2. The application give me the value of the scale but it didn't mention any advise 3. When I use Huawei watch GT 2 and use the workouts the watch doesn't get any notifications. Can the support team advise about these?,3
Huawei Health,Unable to reset password. Sup wants me to input details of a phone I had in 2010. Maybe I'm different but I don't have any info on that device except the name,1
Huawei Health,"Works perfectly Wish I had bought a Huawei Band 4 for the independent GPS so I could leave my phone at home while workouts, but works amazing with my Honor Band 5.",5
Huawei Health,"Few problems I have experienced is that I don't get weather reports on my watch if I connect watch to phone other than Huawei, it used to work fine, I can not update firmware on my watch and troubleshooting isn't working in the app. My gt2 watch and Xiaomi redmi Note 7 uses to work great and without these bugs.",3
Huawei Health,No data synchronised with Google fit and no heart rate data is communicated from the smart band during exercise. Also no heart rate sync with Strava. Bloody useless,1
Huawei Health,Still I can't set the source of steps of its just mixed up all the data and merge it... That's unfair why should we need smartwatch then.... Resolve this issue asap,2
Huawei Health,"Allover it is Satisfying. I am using with huawei band 4. It only need a blood pressure monitor, and it would be completed. Blood oxigen monitor, heart beat monitor working fine. Sleep cycle monitor nearly very accurate. I am very happy with it.",4
Huawei Health,"The notifications of my Android 10 device is not showing anything to my honor band 5. Every time its come when I first setup the app and pair the device, but after that it doesn't show anything at all, not even the incoming calls. Please fix it.",1
Huawei Health,Used to work without Huawei ID. Now needs explicit permission to upload everything to the company server before even starting the app.,1
Huawei Health,"80% in Chinese ( I think ) it worked well for a while but now the heart rate monitor has stopped and I can't find how to turn it back on , seriously Huawei how can you let this app carry on like this, sort it out !",2
Huawei Health,The app does not properly synch to the Huawei band 5. Can takes hours and many attempts to connect. I absolutely do NOT recommend this product,1
Huawei Health,Superb app...but there is no reply option in this honor watch... plz update this option soon...& Plz there is connection issue in Gps not as well as garmin connection,5
Huawei Health,"Excellent app, great to record exercise especially good for cycling. Would recommend.",5
Huawei Health,"Early days, seems excellent, was going to get another cycling computer, then saw this watch and app. Does so much more, watch is actually comfortable as well",5
Huawei Health,The App isn't syncing heart rate section at all since 3 months. Tried everything. All updates are up to date. Really poor experience,2
Huawei Health,"Poor quality for the watch prices, also no English only version! All of the articles are written in Chinese, I would like to be able to customise settings in the watch more. I really like the hardware quality of the GT2 but it needs a few more tweaks along with the app!",2
Huawei Health,"Using app on Xiomi Redmi 7 and Huawei GT2e watch. Doesn't save my info under ""profile"" Weather does not work on my watch even though I followed all directions. The Huawei Health app feels so cheaply made and does not work correctly at all. Very amateur product in my opinion.",1
Huawei Health,"No notifications this app is such a pain in ass. Every 2 , 3 days it stops giving app notifications on the watch... (Magiv watch 2) improve this thing rascals",1
Huawei Health,"Worst!!! There is no option to mute a call through Honor Band 5.. there is no option to change the icons.. the band needs location to pair every time.. there is no option for auto connect post pairing, you need to pair it every single time..",1
Huawei Health,The app is very good. I have 1 suggestion. The raise wrist to wake option for watches should have a schedule. So that you can set it to on during day time and off during night time. Now have to do manually every day. Pls address the issue in next update. Thank you in advance,5
Huawei Health,"To further update available in Google play store and Huawei is kind of forcing users to download HMS in order to have further updates available for download, which is really pathetic and seems quite unnecessary when everything used to work just fine previously।। I just wanted to mention Team Huawei that people / users are not happy at all about this and it's not a good experience।। Seems like product is waste now।।",1
Huawei Health,App is good but a serous bug after update the app is not automatically connect with bluetooth it only connects when bluetooth+ gps on..so please fix this bug,5
Huawei Health,Very nice intuitive app. 👍 Expect to be connected to strava as well.,4
Huawei Health,I install the updated app in order to reinstate updating the sleep data which for no reason did not update without any notification from the app. After updated the app's latest version and was forced to create a Huawei ID... Now the app does not store or update any heart rate data! Very disappointed.,2
Huawei Health,I've a honor band 5 and I've noticed sometimes the data on app and band doesn't match. Like The band shows less steps then in this app. Kindly help in this,4
Huawei Health,For my Samsung A50 it is compatible. I really liked the UI as its very simple and easy to use. Huawei band 4 requires phone gps to be On to connect to phone. To be honest I really like the band as its provide very accurate results.,5
Huawei Health,"Earlier I used to have great experience from this app. Now with my new phone Redmi Note 8 pro, I'm unable to sign in, hence cannot retrieve my old health data. As well as cannot update profile elements such as age, date of birth etc. Please reply.",1
Huawei Health,Notifications keeps disconnecting even when it's enabled!!! I HAVE TO UNINSTALL AND REINSTALL THE APP EVERY 3 OR 4 DAYS SO I CAN RECEIVE THE NOTIFICATIONS THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!!!,1
Huawei Health,"There is a problem, I don't know why I need to turn on location and bluetooth at the same time to achieve sync. my honor band 5, I consider that it could work just turning on bluetooth, is really annoying activate also location",2
Huawei Health,A good app for fitness tracking but there are few bugs in some devices like Honor band 4 so please make sure you solve those 😊,5
Huawei Health,Really poor. Sometimes will sync daily data but no storage of weekly/monthly data. Have to download Huawei mobile app 4.0. Won't do it - fitness band useless. Wish l hadn't wasted money on it. Won't buy another product from this company. Binning this one.,1
Huawei Health,"*strenge~app* As i only installed this app in my phone, yet no any band/ watch purchased but this app shows step count 300 or total 1274 steps etc. How this is possible? Without any device how this app showing step count fake values ?",2
Huawei Health,Helpful for maintaining some level of fitness but for the price of the watxh and my expectations of it i would say exceeds them very smart watch good quality and good app! :),5
Huawei Health,Huawei not updating this up. They keep it updated only via AppGallery. You can see difference if you use Huawei phone. Disappointing.,1
Huawei Health,"Only app that show step on notification bar, easy too see and don't need open app to see love it since my huawei gr5, now i use another phone but still using it.",5
Huawei Health,Why new version mandate for login and access to all phone data... This new version has made my watch useless.,1
Huawei Health,i couldn't able to update the watch list and also i couldn't able to add my new device ( Honor Watch Magic 2 ). Trying since 3 days.,1
Huawei Health,"I have the Honor 5 and have to reset my height and weight 20xs and it always goes back to 15'3"" and 90 pounds. Oxygen and heart rate work 5% of the time ..",1
Huawei Health,"Very powerful application but need to add more exercises like hiking, swimming, and most others. An important parameter need to add to application is elevation like elevation gain, elevation loss and max elevation, like the adidas runtastic application. Thanks for your good application.",4
Huawei Health,"The app is working fine 3-4 days, after that does not start anymore. Reinstalled, again worked fine few days and now doesn't start anymore. :( a lot of problems...",1
Huawei Health,Forgot password option is plain stupid. It is again asking for correct password to reset.,1
Huawei Health,This is the worst experience I've ever had with an app. Hanging in galaxy S20+. It just hangs in the most popular Android device out there. Do you guys even test your app at all,1
Huawei Health,Very little functionality on Android 11. Calls/notifications don't work on my watch.,1
Huawei Health,"can't use camera control on my honor band 5. tried reset, unpair and firmware updates. even reinstall the app. doesn't work. dev please fix this issue!",2
Huawei Health,"What the FU_K??? After the recent update the SpO isn't working. It says tighten the strap, I did. Maximum....and nothing is working except the 7 day weather update and a couple of new watch faces..",1
Huawei Health,"Don't work well on other Android phone. The running route in the map is totally out. Straight line cut across buildings and roads, while I running a big curve along canal. At least 6KM run only register as 2.4KM. Pls solve this problem",3
Huawei Health,"Step counter summaries don't work anymore. It says ""your phone doesn't support step counting"". I am wondering since when my phone doesn't support it and why Google fit doesnt come with the same error message.",2
Huawei Health,"Giving low rating to grab attention for few development to he done. 1. Standby watch faces should be more and good 2. From mobile only one should be able to see more information about workout, sleep etc..which is quite possible.",2
Huawei Health,"Problem with tracking cycling path even mobile gps works well. Also, band 4 doesn't notify when massage comes.",2
Huawei Health,"Since the update in June 2020, the connected band 2 pro refuses to measure heart rate constantly during exercise, looses gps positioning and no longer gives calory burn rates properly. Was perfect before updating health, so assume some kind of data transfer bug.",1
Huawei Health,"Its a great app. So far so good. Tracking sleep, exercise and weight ( when connected to huawei scale ). Recommended 👍",4
Huawei Health,"Good app, I use it for about 2 years. feature request: it would be nice to combine speed, heart rate and other things on the map with the track. So you can match particular location on the map with other parameters. Thanks.",4
Huawei Health,Work on step count bug.. You should provide option to select source of step counter.. App shows combine steps of phone and my honor watch.. No option to select source.. Rediculous...,1
Huawei Health,It's been a month now since i brought this band and the SpO2 feature doesn't work. It's says to tighten the band and to stay still every time i try use this feature. Please look at this problem..my current version is 1.1.0.152,2
Huawei Health,Love it!!! If only there is an added feature of knowing the blood pressure😉 its gonna be a 5☆ app👍,4
Huawei Health,"Most surprising function is, sometimes it locks to effectively prevent ppl like me from obsessively check my measurements!",5
Huawei Health,Can you add some more watch faces (already used all watch faces so many times).. mi is providing 1000+ watch faces from 3rd party and their own combined... or can you please allow us to customize watch face from 3rd party app..,5
Huawei Health,"Login system is very bad and never login . Do some thinking yaar come on....🤮 This app is not able to take 1 star, give some update in login system...., If you are able",1
Huawei Health,"Please fix syncing with google fit, or maybe you can add sync with popular apps such as Strava ? I need to sync my heart rate data on google fit / strava. Such a great smart band (honor 5 band) but it's useless without great connectivity to other apps. Thanks",4
Huawei Health,"After updating my mobile into Android 10, all notification stopped, only I get notification on calls, I follow all suggestion but not working at all on Huawei watch gt2e",1
Huawei Health,I need reminder for drinking water. Can you add in this app. I am using honor band 4 - 42D. Ithink it is a good addition of getting good health.,3
Huawei Health,"Easy to use, pretty much accurate for walking, run, sleep records, but definitely NOT Open water swimming, terrible on distance, May be Huawei band firmware wrong measurement.",5
Huawei Health,App sucks. Every update leads to new problems. Example of the latest has me set up as a male in my profile which I am but in my VO2 it's ranking me among women? Also doesn't properly record the heart rate zones that I am in on the app.,1
Huawei Health,I have a connection problem with my Honor Smart Band. Not listed. I did reset also failed. MAC: E4:19:C1:BF:57:3F,1
Huawei Health,"I Use My Huawei Watch GT2 For My Regular Use as Normal Watch, I Don't Connect My Watch With Mobile. But The Watch Bluetooth Is Always On, There is No Option in Settings to Make Bluetooth Off in The Watch. This Bluetooth Eat My Watch Battery Whole Day Long. Can You Not Give Bluetooth On/Off Option in Watch ?? Hope You Will Answer..",1
Huawei Health,Needs the location for everything! It takes a long time to download the sleep data and sometime it does even work!,1
Huawei Health,It has stopped working in india. Asking to update app but no update is available. Whats the problem ? Kindly fix it Asap...,3
Huawei Health,I can't update the fit2 background. The update is not compatible with all devices and not working fine,2
Huawei Health,Terrible experience...total monopoly from Huwaei...the device list is not updated in the app installed from google play store...,1
Huawei Health,"Unworthy for non huawei android phone users. You should provide option for outdoor cycling in the ""workouts"". Plz add that option atleast in next update",1
Huawei Health,"Absolutely rubbish trying to contact to fit watch won't even recognise my phone number, only one ever had. Absolutely disappointing that can't connect to my phone. O when went to help everything was in Chinese nothing in english in help centre!",1
Huawei Health,I think the sleep tracking is backwards. How can I continuously have normal to high REM sleep yet my deep sleep is always low and light sleep is always high? I think the Chinese have that switched around and it got fouled up in the translation.,3
Huawei Health,Doesn't sync data with Google Fit. (I gave grant and auto sync is on but nada). I'll get a refund for my watch this is unacceptable.,1
Huawei Health,Huawei band 4 not in the app list and also not going to update always says network error. Other then that my wifi work perfectly. Very bad experience with this app and band 4.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"The latest update has ruined the app!!! I have the app synced with my smartwatch, which used to track my reps, specific workout (eg. Hammer curls, overhead press, etc.), and even count down my rest time between sets. It looks like it can no longer do any of this! It only tracks the amount of time I worked out (as well as a few other things), which is basically useless for weight training. I'm VERY disappointed with this change!!! Do I really have to go back to using pen and paper?!?!",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"So we get all these updates, which we can't use as the app still lags, it still crashes, it still will not show the distance graph (though it will provide an average). Can't even switch between home, journal and profile. Would rather have a working app than additional features. Get the app working first, then add additional features.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Great redesign update today. Here are few suggestions- 1. Please add pace / speed to the image of workout shared along with other details. 2. Track users sleep on the basis of how much user uses phone between bedtime schedules. I believe Google fit had this feature years ago. Not all use or able to afford wearables. 3. Please add option for landscape mode for activity tracking screen.,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,This used to be such a good app. Tracked things well and synced with my Xaiomi band. After a few updates the home screen doesn't show any steps or heart points. Journal never gets populated anymore. And daily activities always has oops something went wrong. Jeep on sending feedback through the support on the app but nothing is fixed. Nothing is sent to me to try to fix the issues. I wonder if Google is stopping Google fit and making a new app. It would be nice to know.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Not up to the mark. I use fossil gen 5 with wearos to track my activity. Everyday I go for hiking almost 5-6Km. Whenever I turned on the hiking activity in my watch I can get the data like I got 150heart point and I trekk 6km. The Km data is apprximately true but not sure about heart points. For the same trekk if I do not turn on the hiking activity number of steps will be same but the KM conversion get reduce to 2Km and heart point reduced up to 8 points.,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Was really happy with this app when I first got my watch. Now I'm finding the steps are off. I can walk around a room, count the steps and the watch won't even register, Fitbit is bang on. Lately I get no heart points either. I walked 5km and not one point! I've also forgotten to stop an activity and it counted my driving (I can't run 100km/hr!) and I couldn't edit it out; needs to be more editable or more intelligent.",4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Steps are constantly off and lately I'm noticing that steps will randomly disappear. I have two trackers installed because my other apps won't play nice with the other one (which always has accurate steps, go figure). For example: I have 3798 steps right now and Fit had that before abruptly rewinding to 3464. This is infuriating because it messes up the goals of my other apps. Fix this mess, please! I'll gladly increase my rating when you do.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"terrible interface. not many options for editing, tracking fitness. the app on my watch is in a constant loop asking for permissions and information which is already available in my Google Fit account like weight and height. seems like there are too many broken seams. this app has never been able to deliver a good user experience and i don't expect that to change.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,As much as I want this to be a good app it isn't. I do different types of activities every day and have also linked to Strava but the majority of the time the data does not download. Not sure what Google are trying to do with this but needs a lot more work!,2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,It's not fit for purpose on galaxy phones. Basically all it does is guess and never counts a step in real time. You are better off sticking with Samsung health. Today I had a difference of 3000 steps. It stopped working when I was on my evening walk. Oh and I had forgotten. It doesn't allow syncing with other apps.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Not detecting Steps and Heart Points. I have been using the app since close to one week. It was working fine until yesterday, however since then it isn't detecting the steps and heart Points. Not sure what might be an issue. I have just updated the app with latest update and yet to see if this update would fix the issue. Apart from this I feel the App is really good to help us all our activities and encourage us as well. Would have rated 5 if this issue is fixed",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Latest version of the app cant count steps, I know it's about heart points. But it used to be helpful at making me leave my desk more often and walk around the site more.( The wife has a Fitbit and tries for 10,000 a day, so we would compete.) Also doesn't record milage at all with GPS on all the time it used to give all the small trips and walks to give total milage. One pretty long walk of 19km, recorded at 0km, with no heart points. I guess I was walking fast enough..",4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"I used to like this app, all summer I would use it for hikes, walks, and other work outs. It would keep track of where I went and how many steps. But since Oct it doesn't track my steps, or my km. It skips my entire work out all together. It is frustrating.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Frustratingly close to being good. However, sleep recording software isn't in use, my Ticwatch Pro heart rate etc. isn't recorded overnight. Also mileage on cycling and Walking is recorded haphazardly, a recent ride with the kids logged correctly initially as 12 miles after completing the ride, turned to 1.4 miles the next day. Even adding in a psuedo mile marker at about 7 miles on the route taken map shown. Annoying little things, but definitely a C- could do better from Google.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Keeps changing my journal entries. I'll go for a run and it'll accurately measure my distance. Then the next day the distance is changed to about 1/4 of what I did and ruins the ability to track everything. But app is still a solid choice for weight and blood pressure tracking.",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"New update for Wear OS got rid of strength training capabilities. Before, tracker would automaticly detect excercise and give room for rests between sets. Now it treats every workout like cardio. I thought google was finally going to get serious about Fit?!?!? When will they actually spend time working on an app before sending it out like dog food to their users",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"December 2020 update addresses some of the missing features, adding better sleep tracking and analysis of overall health. A big step in the right direction. Like many others I'd like to see garmin/strava integration (current strava link is terrible)",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"I was very happy with this app, but following the 19th November update it no longer tracks my steps or heart points. It still tracks my workout in regards to distance and location, but the latest update has killed steps and heart points for me.",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Glitchy as hell. This app straight up doesn't track my runs some days and then catches it other days even though I haven't changed anything. It will also accidentally record an ab workout I record manually for 10 hours but mark it for 12 hours instead. It also doesn't let me edit events from time to time. So frustrating.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"A great app. I've been using it at least from 2 years now. Have to say that I feel genuinely happy and satisfied with the app: from his aesthetic and design, to every service that it offers. The track of activities in background is both, precise and sensitive. Simply a great app. Thanks for your work to develop this apps without an extra cost. :)",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Never had a problem till the recent update. Once you push enter, the information is stuck now. Used to could edit entries say you pushed a wrong button.. now my sleep tracker thinks I slept for 24 hours last night.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"November 10, 2020 after-walk update: AMAZING. It actually worked better than MapMyFitness. I forgot to pause, quit and save MMF on my return and it added some phantom distance. Fit gave me an extra .25 miles, but it knew to stop when I stood at my Mac to read email. It gave me the best reading, by far. I believe it was turning on maps that forced it to fully cover my walk. I will up my rating from 1 to 3 and increase it to 4 after a good week and maybe 5 after a good month. One thing, though. A 4.57 mile walk is longer than 4,981 steps. Yesterday, with a miscalculation of the same route as 2.24 miles, it said 5,729 steps. So, back to only a 2. The app still needs fixing. Original review: I have used Map My Walk for years and, most of the time, it tracks mileage well, the only exceptions after a bad update or when I needed to reboot my iPhone. Google Fit, on the other hand, doesn't know a mile from a Philly Cheesesteak. I walk 6.5+/- miles every afternoon, yet Google Fit shows the distance as 3-something. While I'm slowing at age 66 in 95 degree heat, it doesn't take me nearly 2 hours to walk 3+ miles and it's the exact same route that I've been walking for the past couple of months, after walking a similar, but mile-shorter route for the past couple of years. What good is setting a 10,000 step goal, when Google Fit is telling me I've walked something short of 8,000 steps? (Note that I moved to Android over a month ago and Map My Walk was giving me 6.5+/- miles on Android, too.) November 10, 2020 update: I tried your advice, but my settings for location are either on or off. The only changes I could make were to allow access to storage and always show maps, which I did for both. I will again edit this after today's walk, but I'm sure it won't help. Only MapMyWalk and MapMyFitness do it right but, unfortunately, those won't help me for my any health insurance benefits. You really need to fix this app.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"This app sucks, I have the Lg G smartwatch and this app wont even track sleep or show me if it is connected to my watch or phone because if my phone is nearby and both devices are still connected and if i walk around it doesnt register that i am moving and it doesnt count my steps. Please let samsung show you how to make apps that work well with fitness because this is ridiculous.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Switched to Google Fit as Endomondo I've been using for years will be no more. Used it for my walk this afternoon, all seems well until I ended the workout then half the distance/calories/heart points disappeared. Opted for this app for it's ability to link with myfitnesspal but that didn't work either. Will give it one more go tomorrow if not I'll uninstall and go on the search again. Also keeps knocking 11lbs off my weight, wouldn't mind if it physically did that",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Maybe I don't know how to use it? But no instructions either! Downloaded to phone and wanted to track simple walk. It started with 511 calories..and it keeps adding to them. I just opened the app, I haven't gone anywhere yet! Why 511 calories? I uninstalled, and reinstalled, still has all my info. I wanted a simple tracking device for step, but, this isn't it.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Activities, in my case running, don't get tracked correctly. For example: i just completed an 17 km run, but the app stops counting kilometers while still recognizing my active time. Furthermore the complete run has been successfully tracked by the app strava; the sensors of my mobile phone are all right.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"The tracking and monitoring is so much harder and more inaccurate than it has ever been, trying to use this along with my mi band for calorie tracking but it's a tad bit too annoying since the units are in the US customary unit system. Makes no sense why they wouldn't let the user choose the units or let the app autodetect based on the users region. Heart points feature is very gimickey and could do away with it.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I am pretty happy with this and very happy that you put the steps back in. The one other feature I would like is if we could set so this starts when the system starts up. As it is if I reboot my phone and forget to start fit then I don't get any journal entries until such time as I do start it.,4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Lovely and well-designed app. Accurately reads if I have done a brisk walk or moved around my house. And then when I'm home, I see that the rings are full. Keep it up Google, your apps have some of the best and minimal designs 😍👍",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Ok, it's been months since this ""big"" update that resulted in loss of functionality for most active people. Google had an app that was working for all sports as it was recording Move Minutes, now it is completely useless as it counts Steps. It's a step counter. Nothing more. Soooo, if you ride a bicycle or swim, that activity doesn't count. Google has been doing weird things lately, ""proud"" Pixel user here....and now Google will send me a reminder not to rate their app badly. Happy dayz ✌️",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Would be a great addition to my fitness apps if it did what it claims. Says it syncs with other apps like strava, that has heart rate, distance and power output. Fit chooses when it feels like getting the data from the ""synchronised"" app. It is rare that it chooses to. It only takes the last activity, so doesnt update the errors it has made. Because of this the data cant be trusted. I burned 2500 cals in3.5 hours on zwift, strava updated no probs. Fit said 1900 cals for the day! Poor quality",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"No doubts that the app is best and universally compatible for all mobile brands as well as smart bands and watch. We can track almost any activity. Just one small update is needed which make the app more user friendly and interactive. There is no facility of auto-pause in between activities, it we stop for few seconds then the tracking must be pause and if we continue the it should again resume. Also if there will be personal health adviser and verbal feedback of activity then it will be best.",4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Has been absolutely ruined by the removal of move minutes as a goal. Steps doesn't work as a goal if you are doing your exercise in a gym or on a bike, and that's before we get to the fact that it is completely excluding many disabled people. Bring back move minutes as an option when setting your goals.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It meets all my needs for a fitness app. I especially love the Strength Training mode, which automatically tracks your excercises without you having to manually enter them. I also like the concept of ""Heart Points"" and the slick and awfully familiar design of the rings, that indicate Heart Points and steps. I never really got why people hate Google Fit so much. The only thing I don't like about Google Fit is how often they change their motive, going from one thing to ""healthy hearts"" quickly.",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Revised review after Android 10 update. Performance of GPS mapping seems greatly improved, this could be a result of android update but I should also add that I am now manually adding and requesting fit app to track events rather than relying on fit auto mapping (which had been unbelievably poor). It's early days since the android update and have only had a few opportunities to retest, but provisionally I'm raising my review from the earlier woeful 1* to 4*",4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Each update lessens the utility. All it does now is track time and heart rate on my smart watches. For weight lifting, no longer tracks type of exercise, # of reps, # of sets. Useless. Already have heart rate apps, and a clock. Typical Google, updates with no advance warning of what you'll lose",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Login issues seem to be fixed and I was finally able to try out this app. Great features. I find it useful for collecting data from wyze scale and passing it on to the LoseIt app. Also I weigh myself 2-3 times per day and I wanted to track my daily average which the wyze app does not currently do but google fit does! Lastly this app is also useful for converting your smart phone into a pedometer.,5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Largely a failure when it comes to real-time activity tracking using any fitness tracker/smart watch device. Has delayed syncs and even misses activities altogether (observed this for few top smart watches). This app is good mostly for collecting activity data from phone sensors which is seldom accurate (Google still wants to mine it). Most likely this buggy, low budget app is still around so that Google is able to tick 'fitness tracking' feature for Android platform when compared to iPhone.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I have compare this app from Samsung health. Samsung health is accurate and show the exact figure but on the other hand google fit is displaying less steps and less km for the same. And also update the app when mobile data is off app won't work properly and display the less numbers. Kindly fix the bug.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,The app has suddenly started to track all my driving activity as bike rides. For the past couple days my commute to work is now counting as activity. Horrible. Ever since they removed Move Minutes as a goal in the beginning of the pandemic I've stopped using the app and still see no reason to use it.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"The app most of time is absolutely splendid. For working out and counting steps gives a fairly good estimate compared to what my phone says. But... There's a huge but here. A lot of compatibility with other apps and data sync is awful. Example, will workout a round of P90X and in the smartwatch the phone indicates everything well (though sometimes it goes crazy saying I've enough heart points being all day in my chair). When opening the app sleep or the workout points ain't always synchronized",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Doesn't track my walks properly. I seem to get practically zero heart points, despite walking at pace. My partner uses the same app., but gets up to 40 heart points for the same length of time / pace as myself. It also records significantly less steps than my partner after the same period of time and effort. Can't find any help on the app either. Disappointing.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"App was working fine until the recent update, does not show as a connected Google app and does not show in the list to be synced. It tracks the activity but does not update other connected apps. I've tried many troubleshooting options and nothing has worked.",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"I use the Huawei Honor Band 5 so have to use Huawei Health app. Google Fit app states that it can sync data from many different sources - great! However, this is clearly not true. It has impacted on the playability of PokémonGo as well as it only reads data from this app only. I have tried clearing data, cache, uninstall, reinstall, etc but still doesn't work. Therefore this is a useless app.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Decent app but could do with a major update. Having come from Fitbit, I was disappointed that googlefit doesn't have any way of recording calories in/out built into the app. This is a major part of me using these devices so it is annoying that I have to install another app to do this. Additionally having more precise workout trackings like stravia eg tracking fitness levels would be a great addition. Hopefully Google invests a bit more time into this app.",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Love the app and the integration available with other apps. Although I really wish that the nutrition info Google fit does recieve from my calorie tracking apps could be summarized as it was with previous versions? Also possibly syncing with period trackers could be a great addition. Great app, thank you",4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Doesn't display all information available. I have a Withings sleep tracker that syncs to Google Fit, and another app syncs THAT data to Samsung Health. I can see all the sleep stages (deep, light, REM) in SHealth, so Google Fit has the data, it's just choosing to not use it.",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It's not that great since the update it used to link with games that have walking features now it doesn't. Plus I walk the same walk every morning and I get different heart points, some days it gives me 5 sometimes 8 and lots of times it gives me 0 so the heart point tracker does not function. I think I'm going to uninstall and try a different one.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Have been using for about half a year now and still have massive sync issues. Another major issue is even though I walk at working going from that to starting a bike ride home Google for thinks I've run home at 25kph. Try to sync in journal and just get the watch X icon as usual. Overall should have bought the Garmin venue and stuck with hardware and software that worked (Fossil gen5),2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Needs improvement. I started using this app 4 days ago because it is meant to work with 'MyDietDaily', but workouts from this app doesn't sink, I have to enter it manually. It doesn't sink with other all smartwatches. Another issue is it takes a while before it counts steps. ",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Good app, please allow adding more parameters like Oxygen saturation, wbc, platelet count and so on.

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Used to love it on the wear os watch app but since they got rid of the measuring workouts section so now it's just a HR and calorie monitor it's essentially useless. Used to be able to measure rest time and my workout really well but now it's an utterly point less app,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Poor tracking because it supposed to track down my movements while using any fitness related apps such as NTC. Now, Google Fit's not progressing like it was before. It's a pain-in-the-neck because it showed me smaller numbers rather than bigger numbers. Fix it.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Since recent update, I can no longer connect to My Plate its doesnt recognize it. Google fit and myplate both updated on my phone last night. I used to love using them together and lost a lot of weight using them. Please fix it! I use an android device.",1

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?
",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I like it but needs a share button that when pressed brings up all your phones options for sharing to apps that are on your phone. In addition calorie count needs a programming tweak to add 3 to 5 calories when walking on elevations. Should be simple for programmers to do.,3

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Walked 3.64 km today and counted only 60 steps despite the phone settings for tracking activity being enabled. This has been the case for previous days also. Big Fail !,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Many a times it didn't detect my footsteps. My Android has those sensors which does the job. Please fix.,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I like how it updates the heart points once it has data from my heart rate monitor and app (Polar H10/Polar Beat) Perhaps it could record HR in the app without external app? Keep up the good work team,5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"While this app tries to be THE fitness app of the Android ecosystem, in my opinion it just lacks many niche features that make other apps better. Maybe it's the need to satisfy the big ecosystem, or maybe it's Google's lack of interest on this app... But this app needs to be better.",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I like the simplicity of the app. It will be great though to add option for intermittent fasting to gain complete picture of one's health.,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I like the simplicity of the app. It will be great though to add option for intermittent fasting to gain complete picture of one's health.,5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I don't understand how a company as big as Google can have such a terrible app. I have a watch with wear os and it always has issues syncing. Additionally 3rd party integration is week compared to other competitors.,2

This is great news for Google fit users. Thank You Google Team.",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Okay at best. Why does it not let you edit treadmill distance (non GPS accuracy is terrible for me). This seems like a major drop of the ball!,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Location tracking is not working if the phone is not in range. Please fix the issue. My location is on in wear settings.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,It is good but the only missing feature is for us developers we make devices but we dont have an app for it because we rely on Arduino and Raspberry PI They dont have an API so if Google Fit had one we will be very HAPPY and grateful,5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Doesn't track activity correctly. Wrong activity and wrong distance/duration. Google maps works way more accurately. I'm using a Google pixel 3 phone.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It doesn't count steps like ice skating. First 2hrs it counted 5k, then 2nd 2 hrs nothing when the second half I had more distance and steps covered. Why? My phone already counted more than 10k while this app only 5k.",1

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,The integration with Health Mate seems to have broken last week. Could be Fit or Health Mates fault though. Switched to Health Mate though since this is the only one with heart rate and sleep data now,2

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Heart points dramatically reduced on latest version (I do the same routes daily) and recording of the journey on the map is terrible (random straight lines),2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"I am facing getting my steps data synced from my noise app. I have noise fit evolve watch. Rest of data getting synced without any issue, but my step data is not getting synced. Can someone check and help?",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,I have been waiting for several years for compatibility with the Samsung Gear watch ...Still nothing. Maybe a connection to Samsung Health?,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,The app doesn't track the activity properly. I've walk 7000 steps and it only shows barely 1000 steps on 2 consecutive days. Very disappointed.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Why there is big discrepancy with Samsung Health? It happened to have few hundred steps difference. Google fit counts less, I am using it together with Samsung Health.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Doesn't save information. Have to record weight daily. Doesn't sync data accurately. Also reports less than what's on the fitness watch.,2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Its sometimes works and sometimes doesn't in terms of activity, the color os system worked until I activated fit, then the watch step and floor counter started malfunctioning",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Great app! I really like the heart points modality of scoring. It really tells if you've been exercising effectively.,4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"very good app but only reason to 4 stars is that if we do not turn on any workout it does not count your heart points . what points are counted mostly by turning on workout",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It could not show my average time sleep during a year. In the last version, i could see but now it doesnt work. Please fix it",4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"3 heart points for walking to my car and 0 heart points for a 5km run (loaded from Runkeeper). It is pretty hard to take this app seriously. It used to be better, sad.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Very happy with this app I feel eager daily to fulfill my goal of walking distance. N I try to increase it. Keeping healthy walking Thanks Google fit.,5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,App has simple and easy to use interface but it takes time to update the score unlike other popular app. Hope Google will see it to improve.,1

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,It used to work fine but it isn't tracking any steps or anything now. Please fix and I'll give a higher rating.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Excellent app, I use it every day to keep track of my walks. Very accurate and using the oxigen sensor is the best",4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,With this version. I can't edit my sleep duration. I added the hour asleep wrong and I can't edit it anymore. But for the previous version I could to edit it.,5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Like it better than Samsung, made the switch from S3 Frontier to TicWatch Pro 4G and can't be happier. It works like a charm.",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"The UI is fantastic. The integrations to the fitness ecosystem is also great. Helps me connect my workout devices and other apps, even food tracking apps like MyFitnessPal. The biggest benefit is that the app helps me have a metric-basex way to track my progress and pursue my goals. That makes it very useful and helps give the satisfaction after a day of activity. The heart points feature helps me know that I have included enough intensity on my daily activities for a healthier lifestyle.",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It needs a lot more improvements. It should be more precise, fast and accurate. Afterall it is a Google product.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Great app, but you cannot!!!! Delete third party exercises that was imported into Google fit by other apps. Which is a big BIG no no.",2

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Workout tracker is not working on LG Wing. I have location set to ""always on"", but it's not tracking anything.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Bit inaccurate with map tracking and when it's on auto mode it skips about first 5 minutes before it realizes what activity I'm doing. Edit: I'm adding another star to this app, since last few updates this app has become what it should have been from the start. I'm happy with all the new features that give lots of info about activity. But still map accuracy is sometimes odd and doesn't register heat beat info from my smart watch. Thanks google keep up to great work!

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Please fix the glitching, or app is useless. I've been using this app for months now for hiking, walking, swimming, etc. and haven't had any issues. Recently, while hiking, I will go to check my progress in the app, and all I see is a loading wheel as if the app has lost connection. By the time I finish my hike, the majority of my activity has not even been recorded, which means that the information is not accurate. Please fix this issue, or I will have to uninstall permanently.

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"This was working fine until a few months ago but seems to be full of glitches recently. its not tracking activity well and is very very slow. I am unable to link it to my wear OS samrtwatch (I have bought this less than a week ago). I have tried everything that is recommended on the google help page but the two do not sync at all!

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Distance tracking is not good. Sometimes confusing. Distance tracking and step count is not in sync.,3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,The steps are not accurate and it doesn't synce with other health/fitness programs. Had to get an additional app to synce to Samsung Health.,2

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"The app is too slow. When you want to cancel your old track, it takes ages to close. If you got the back button, you can get to Start Walking again. But then it won't count your distance. You have to restart the phone. It's a total see waste of time.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"When I am walking it is not counting my steps 🥺🥺 that's why I have given the 1 star if you solve the problem I will edit the rating and give 5 star 🌟",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It was working fine when I had installed it. But after a couple of weeks I started observing an issue where the app reduces the distance+points+cal after working out for a certain time. This issue is intermittent and is very irritating. Please fix this soon.",2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Great app but only marks the path in straight lines only curvy routes ain't considered hence cuts down on the actual distance walked/ran",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Google tries to do everything rather than do something good and never gets anything done right or without an agenda. Do a noon walk everyday, each day the results are different.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"No way to set sensitivity, that I could find. Using for health insurance benefit, and only tracks approximately 53% of my steps. Disappointed. Very easy to set up and navigate, just wish it actually tracked all my steps, like my good phone pedometer does. Update: I notice it also subtracts steps occasionally! And if you add an activity, like walking, working out, gardening, etc, and record your steps it does not add all your steps. Basically worthless as an activity, step tracker. 0 stars!",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Why the hell you people come with these kinds of updates ? It's just a degrade. Previous version was so good and prompt. This update don't even count steps. Please don't update until it's necessary. Bogus update this is.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Very good for keeping track of hiking and snowshoeing. Better resolution on altitude would make it better.,4
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Showing wrong step count.. I am at home today and just download this app. Before Half and hour. It is show you walked 300 step. Bedroom to kitchen it is count 300 step,2

Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Please bring back old color logo. The new one is not unique and hard to differentiate with other google apps.",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,This app doesn't even track half the steps I take in a day. Sometimes I open the app and it takes steps away from me.,1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It simply does not sync. I have read all the FAQ, enabled all the permissions, reinstalled a bunch of times. Since I have it to feed data to Noom, I have to add an activity to reflect my steps progress for the whole endeavour to show a somewhat clear picture of my progress. This is a fail. I hope you can fix it soon. Cheers",1
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Great, it works well for me especially the settings that can be changed. Helps out a lot. Good guidelines and encouragement updates👍😃👏",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"Uhh, there's a new problem, I don't know if it is in your app or Zepp, but your app only shows heart rate and does not sync steps and workouts anymore",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"This worked great for a year and then got all squirrelly. Turns out battery saver turned itself on and I didn't realize it. Once I turned battery saver off, Fit once again worked perfectly. I think developer should add a battery saver check on startup with a msg that pops up and tells user to turn it off for oblivious people like me",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,All I want is heart rate. Can't remove other app icons. Also stupid is hand wash timer but can't get rid of that either!,2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,The previous update was fine but now I can't edit my sleep schedule and I sometimes forget to change the AM to PM.,2
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"This thing is insane! It keeps track of all my workouts, gives me heart points, tells my steps, and you can set up all these different activities. Like tons of them! I think there was around a hundred! Super accurate and super awesome! Keep it up Google!",5
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,"It's Good, But Could Be Great I like the tracking, the integration, the interfaces, how it looks on my watch and phone. But pretty please, can you please let the users share with each other? It's more fun when you can compete with friends. I do like the challenges you added. Thanks for that.",3
Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,At least once a day the app stops counting my steps and will reverse 1000 or so steps and then stop updating for 5-45 minutes.,3

Mi Fit,"I can't look heart rate in graph it is too hard. I want to see every 5 min heart rate but I cannot touch because it is too small in the graph it should also be listed. also I took off bracelet but it still measures heart rate so heart rate measuring seems fake to me. also sleep monitoring should be ...",1
Mi Fit,"Generally happy, but the last few updates seem to swing between thinking my Deep Sleep is fine vs always not enough, even although the amount each night has not really changed. Will be interesting to see what the lastest update says. Yep latest is back to saying my Deep Sleep is fine. Hard to trust ...

Mi Fit,"The manual is in Chinese so I can't fully utilize my new Mi Band 5. One thing that bothers me is that it does not monitor my sleep. There is no data since day 1. I have gone through all the setting, but still the problem persists. Even after the latest firmware update, the sleep monitor doesn't work...

Mi Fit,"I like the simplicity of this app and watch together. It tracks what I'm interested in and it's not intrusive. The layout is clean, and after a couple days, I learned where things were. .

Mi Fit,"It's not working with MIUI 12 on my Redmi Note 8... It will show incoming call notification some how but not any app notification and no msg whatsapp nothing else.

Mi Fit,"It's a God app but there is one thing that I don't like, that you can't connect two bands at a same time. So if possible change this system. Then I will think to give this app all the five stars.",5
Mi Fit,"Guys. U really need to add something like a changelog with each update in the app. Like the November 4 2020 firmware update, the app asked me to allow a new track this activity.. Which I couldn't see what it was because it started to update the firmware automatically. People need to know if somethin...

Mi Fit,"Lift wrist to view info is too responsive. Even while i riding a bike, everytime using a clutch, the screen turns ON. Sleep tracking need to be corrected. Deep sleep is too low after enabling the REM sleep monitoring which is correctly showing by other Fitness app

Mi Fit,"Amazing app! Only thing I can add as a feedback is to add the feature of being able to set and change the alarm time directly from the smart mi band 5. Keep up the good work!
",5
Mi Fit,"Cannot sync workout data into my phone apps while other data all available. I've try deleting many old workout data to clear space, restart watch, update app it still not work. Maybe giving up and buy the other brand is the best way to solve this problem.
",2
Mi Fit,"The app asks many times for the state I'm living in. It is pointless I live outside US. The fonts in the app are weight too small, magnifying glasses are needed to read across. Would be nice to have them increased a bit. It does what it says. I'm using it only for communication with smart band.
",3
Mi Fit,"The stress monitor shows no data. It did at the beginning but suddenly one day it shows no data available. I don't know how to fix it. All the others (heart rate, sleep tracker) work just fine.
",2
Mi Fit,"Wish I could edit the ""waking up in sleep"" part. You can only edit the time you eoke up and went to sleep, but not the moments of waking up at night during the sleep - the band doesn't really catch them
",3
Mi Fit,"This app is bad for your mental health. When I walk at 115 and 119 steps in a minute, I burn 4 calories but if I walk at 121 to 125 steps a minute, I burn only 3 calories. That's just one of the many frustrating errors in this app.

Mi Fit,"The Mi Fit band 5 is good, but I don't know why it has stopped tracking my sleeping patterns started few days ago. I hope this problem can be fixed. Is there any ways to solve this? I've updated to latest application few days ago, no change of issues faced.

Mi Fit,"Been pretty happy with the app linked with Amazfit Bip, however latest update has caused the sleep tracking to disappear from the status page along with weight tracking linked to Mi Scale device. Hopefully this will be fixed soon with an update.

Mi Fit,"Thanks for update this app. But why you didn't fix weather related bug. I set my location in this app for weather but my band 5 doesn't show me any weather update. It always show ""Connect to mi fit to get weather info""😕 Please fix it.....",3
Mi Fit,"The heart rate tracker does not exist in the app, and apparently doesn't show on the band.. Plus weather details do not appear, the app only shows ""checking for updates"" but doesn't update the location.

Mi Fit,"Having this app for some 4 years by now. Generally buggy, often some things don't synchronize.

Every update it's getting worse and worse. One star from me. I'll never buy a since thing from Mi store ever again. Wast...
",1
Mi Fit,Love this app. Almost every time I use mi watch 3 and track the usage on the app. It is not very accurate but satisfying results. I would recommend this. Easy to use.,5
Mi Fit,"App is a bit clunky to use and the sleep tracker with MiFit Watch is really unreliable - not good at detecting being awake but relatively still, vs being asleep. Should be able to do so by combining movement sensor data and heart rate data.

Mi Fit,"Everything is fine but when I sleep during afternoon or evening time band won't track sleep data why??... When it tracks during night means it should even track during day time na... So please fix this problem it will so much helpful 🙂

Mi Fit,"I bought a Band 5 to monitor my sleep times, but all Mi Fit says is ""no sleep data"". So I installed ""Master for Mi Band"" and that displays the sleep data OK. The band is obviously gathering the sleep data. An update for Mi Fit a few days ago made me hopeful but nope, no change. Upgrade said ""fixed a...
",1
Mi Fit,"I like the app a lot, but it is not optimized for those of us who work third shift. Ever since I switched, I have had no sleep data recorded because it all happens during daytime hours.

Mi Fit,"The app works well. All functions run fine. Sleep info is interesting to go through and make sure the band has a snug fit to get accurate readings.
",5
Mi Fit,"Easy to install and pair, will come back when I've experienced more :-) coming back to say I love this app, have had no probs with it whatsoever which is a welcome change to other tracker apps I've used
",5
Mi Fit,"The sync at the end of the day is damaged. I always seem to have less steps synced than I have actually made. Also heart rate monitoring doesn't sync prooerly. Update the app already and fix the problem please!
",1
Mi Fit,"The app is okey but some details fail to synchronize hence giving an inaccurate average. The band gives readings when not in use such as when left on a table. This inaccuracy is frustrating.

Mi Fit,"It would be usefull to have some food and water tracking features. The alarm should not be so easy to turn off (maybe to type the PIN code to turn it off)

Mi Fit,"After lasted update my band screen only show ""connect to mi fit to update again"" nothing else. I'd uninstalled the app, restart the phone. Nothing works. I can't use my band after a month of purchased.
",2
Mi Fit,"Good experience. However I'm having the issue with remote camera as it just triggers the volume keys. And the band should stop workout time when I take a break which it does not.
",4
Mi Fit,"good app in general, however statistics on workouts for one month/1year should consolidate not only km because not all workouts are done using km maybe total number of calories & total time, etc each workout has its specifications.",3
Mi Fit,"Records road journeys through vehicle as walking! Idle periods are considered as activity period. Sleep period record has got no relation with actual sleep period( sleep period is considered as awake period)...its a wastage of money and energy. I want my money back.

Mi Fit,"Good, evolving, but needs work. Rough corners, and bugs, but steady and often updates. Despite everything, gets the job done. Should do it in a nicer way though.",4
Mi Fit,"Sometimes the bluetooth connection with the device is suddenly disconnecting. It needa to be reconnected manually. But all in all, this app works great!

Mi Fit,Maybe can look into the DND mode. It can only detect and reflect your sleep pattern at night. When you edit the time in the day it won't reflect it. Please kindly look into it,1
Mi Fit,Why there's no support for Arabic language. When notifications comes in Arabic the letters displays backwards. I can't believe a best selling band in Arabic countries doesn't support Arabic notifications.,2

Mi Fit,"I love your app, but when I try to workout you force me to update and no option to postpone it ( its every single year and I can bet you could feature that work your skilled team within one 2 week sprint). Shame on you",3
Mi Fit,"Every time I install this app, I need to register a new account, because the existing one (I use the same email each time) is not available for a some reason.",2

Mi Fit,"Band4 is not conneting with app. It has connected only 1st time only since i am unable to connect the band again. Having a disconnected band with its own app is really worst product for me. Is there something that can be done to fix it or i have to live with it??
