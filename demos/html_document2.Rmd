Diamond price depends on many features, such as:

- cut (See @tab-tab:by-cut))
- colour (See @tab-tab:by-colour))
- clarity (See @fig-by-clarity))
- carats (See @fig-by-carat))
- See @sec-conclusion) for concluding remarks

## Tables

### Cut

```{r by-cut}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(price),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  kable(digits = 0, 
        col.names = c("Cut", "Average Price"),
        caption = "Mean diamond price by cut.") %>%
  kable_material()
```

### Colour

```{r by-colour}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(price),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  kable(digits = 0, 
        col.names = c("Cut", "Average Price"),
        caption = "Mean diamond price by colour.") %>%
  kable_material()
```

## Plots

### Clarity

```{r by-clarity, fig.cap = "Diamond price by clarity"}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = clarity, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

### Carats

```{r by-carat, fig.cap = "Diamond price by carat"}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  stat_smooth()
```

### Concluding remarks {#sec-conclusion}

I am not rich enough to worry about any of this.
