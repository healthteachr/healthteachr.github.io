## Hockey report

This report summarises the first overall pick data for different types of player position between 1963 and 2022. This data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/nhl-draft-hockey-player-data-1963-2022).

### First overall picks by position

The *total* number of **Left Wings** drafted first was `r hockey_counts$n[3]`

The *total* number of **Centres** drafted first was `r hockey_counts$n[1]`.

The *total* number of **Defensemen** drafted first was `r hockey_counts$n[2]`.

```{r}
# important numbers

n <- nrow(hockey_online) # the total number of players (number of rows)
first <- min(hockey_online$year) # the first (minimum) year
last <- max(hockey_online$year) # the last (maximum) year
```

```{r fig-hockey-drafts}
ggplot(data = hockey_counts, 
       mapping = aes(x = position, 
                     y = n,
